          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first sight
          the interpretation of the European fire customs as charms for
          making sunshine is confirmed by a parallel custom observed by the
          Hindoos of Southern India at the Pongol or Feast of Ingathering.
          The festival is celebrated in the early part of January, when,
          according to Hindoo astrologers, the sun enters the tropic of
          Capricorn, and the chief event of the festival coincides with the
          passage of the sun. For some days previously the boys gather heaps
          of sticks, straw, dead leaves, and everything that will burn. On
          the morning of the first day of the festival the heaps are fired.
          Every street and lane has its bonfire. The young folk leap over the
          flames or pile on fresh fuel. This fire is an offering to Sûrya,
          the sun-god, or to Agni, the deity of fire; it <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“wakes him from his sleep, calling on him again to
          gladden the earth with his light and heat.”</span><a id="noteref_1"
          name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> If this
          is indeed the explanation which the people themselves give of the
          festival, it seems decisive in favour of the solar explanation of
          the fires; for to say that the fires waken the sun-god from his
          sleep is only a metaphorical or mythical way of saying that they
          actually help to rekindle the sun's light and heat. But the
          hesitation which the writer indicates between the two distinct

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A festival of
          Northern India which presents points of resemblance to the popular
          European celebrations which we have been considering is the Holi.
          This is a village festival held in early spring at the full moon of
          the month Phalgun. Large bonfires are lit and young people dance
          round them. The people believe that the fires prevent blight, and
          that the ashes cure disease. At Barsana the local village priest is
          expected to pass through the Holi bonfire, which, in the opinion of
          the faithful, cannot burn him. Indeed he holds his land rent-free
          simply on the score of his being fire-proof. On one occasion when
          the priest disappointed the expectant crowd by merely jumping over
          the outermost verge of the smouldering ashes and then bolting into
          his cell, they threatened to deprive him of his benefice if he did
          not discharge his spiritual functions better when the next Holi
          season came round. Another feature of the festival which has, or
          once had, its counterpart in the corresponding European ceremonies
          is the unchecked profligacy which prevails among the Hindoos at
          this time.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=
          "#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> In
          Kumaon, a district of North-West India, at the foot of the
          Himalayas, each clan celebrates the Holi festival by cutting down a
          tree, which is thereupon stripped of its leaves, decked with shreds
          of cloth, and burnt at some convenient place in the quarter of the
          town inhabited by the clan. Some of the songs sung on this occasion
          are of a ribald character. The people leap over the ashes of the
          fire, believing that they thus rid themselves of itch and other
          diseases of the skin. While the trees are burning, each clan tries
          to carry off strips of cloth from the tree of another clan, and
          success in the attempt is thought to ensure good luck. In Gwalior
          large heaps of cow-dung are burnt instead of trees. Among the
          Marwaris the festival is celebrated by the women with obscene songs
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name=
          "Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and gestures. A
          monstrous and disgusting image of a certain Nathuram, who is said
          to have been a notorious profligate, is set up in a bazaar and then
          smashed with blows of shoes and bludgeons while the bonfire of
          cow-dung is blazing. No household can be without an image of
          Nathuram, and on the night when the bride first visits her husband,
          the image of this disreputable personage is placed beside her
          couch. Barren women and mothers whose children have died look to
          Nathuram for deliverance from their troubles.<a id="noteref_3"

          stories are told to account for the origin of the Holi festival.
          According to one legend it was instituted in order to get rid of a
          troublesome demon (<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="sa"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">rákshasí</span></span>). The people were
          directed to kindle a bonfire and circumambulate it, singing and
          uttering fearlessly whatever might come into their minds. Appalled
          by these vociferations, by the oblations to fire, and by the
          laughter of the children, the demon was to be destroyed.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Chinese
          province of Fo-Kien we also meet with a vernal festival of fire
          which may be compared to the fire-festivals of Europe. The
          ceremony, according to an eminent authority, is a solar festival in
          honour of the renewal of vegetation and of the vernal warmth. It
          falls in April, on the thirteenth day of the third month in the
          Chinese calendar, and is doubtless connected with the ancient
          custom of renewing the fire, which, as we saw, used to be observed
          in China at this season.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href=
          "#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> The
          chief performers in the ceremony are labourers, who refrain from
          women for seven days, and fast for three days before the festival.
          During these days they are taught in the temple how to discharge
          the difficult and dangerous duty which is to be laid upon them. On
          the eve of the festival an enormous brazier of charcoal, sometimes
          twenty feet wide, is prepared in front of the temple of the Great
          God, the protector of life. At sunrise next morning the brazier is
          lighted and kept <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg
          004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          burning by fresh supplies of fuel. A Taoist priest throws a mixture
          of salt and rice on the fire to conjure the flames and ensure an
          abundant year. Further, two exorcists, barefooted and followed by
          two peasants, traverse the fire again and again till it is somewhat
          beaten down. Meantime the procession is forming in the temple. The
          image of the god of the temple is placed in a sedan-chair,
          resplendent with red paint and gilding, and is carried forth by a
          score or more of barefooted peasants. On the shafts of the
          sedan-chair, behind the image, stands a magician with a dagger
          stuck through the upper parts of his arms and grasping in each hand
          a great sword, with which he essays to deal himself violent blows
          on the back; however, the strokes as they descend are mostly
          parried by peasants, who walk behind him and interpose bamboo rods
          between his back and the swords. Wild music now strikes up, and
          under the excitement caused by its stirring strains the procession
          passes thrice across the furnace. At their third passage the
          performers are followed by other peasants carrying the utensils of
          the temple; and the rustic mob, electrified by the frenzied
          spectacle, falls in behind. Strange as it may seem, burns are
          comparatively rare. Inured from infancy to walking barefoot, the
          peasants can step with impunity over the glowing charcoal, provided
          they plant their feet squarely and do not stumble; for usage has so
          hardened their soles that the skin is converted into a sort of
          leathery or horny substance which is almost callous to heat. But
          sometimes, when they slip and a hot coal touches the sides of their
          feet or ankles, they may be seen to pull a wry face and jump out of
          the furnace amid the laughter of the spectators. When this part of
          the ceremony is over, the procession defiles round the village, and
          the priests distribute to every family a leaf of yellow paper
          inscribed with a magic character, which is thereupon glued over the
          door of the house. The peasants carry off the charred embers from
          the furnace, pound them to ashes, and mix the ashes with the fodder
          of their cattle, believing that it fattens them. However, the
          Chinese Government disapproves of these performances, and next
          morning a number of the performers may generally be seen in the
          hands of the police, laid face downwards on the ground and
          receiving a sound castigation on a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          midsummer bonfire in Russia.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7"

          shall see presently, such customs may perhaps be interpreted as
          magical rites designed to produce light and warmth by subjecting
          the deity himself to the heat and glow of the furnace; and where,
          as at Barsana, priests or sorcerers have been accustomed in the
          discharge of their functions to walk through or over fire, they
          have sometimes done so as the living representatives or embodiments
          of deities, spirits, or other supernatural beings. Some
          confirmation of this view is furnished by the beliefs and practices
          of the Dosadhs, a low Indian caste in Behar and Chota Nagpur. On
          the fifth, tenth, and full-moon days of three months in the year,
          the priest walks over a narrow trench filled with smouldering wood
          ashes, and is supposed thus to be inspired by the tribal god Rahu,
          who becomes incarnate in him for a time. Full of the spirit and
          also, it is surmised, of drink, the man of god then mounts a bamboo
          platform, where he sings hymns and distributes to the crowd leaves
          of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tulsi</span></span>, which cure incurable
          diseases, and flowers which cause barren women to become happy
          mothers. The service winds up with a feast lasting far into the
          night, at which the line that divides religious fervour from
          drunken revelry cannot always be drawn with absolute
          precision.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href=

          Similarly the Bhuiyas, a Dravidian tribe of Mirzapur, worship
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name=
          "Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> their tribal hero
          Bir by walking over a short trench filled with fire, and they say
          that the man who is possessed by the hero does not feel any pain in
          the soles of his feet.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href=

          Ceremonies of this sort used to be observed in most districts of
          the Madras Presidency, sometimes in discharge of vows made in time
          of sickness or distress, sometimes periodically in honour of a
          deity. Where the ceremony was observed periodically, it generally
          occurred in March or June, which are the months of the vernal
          equinox and the summer solstice respectively. A narrow trench,
          sometimes twenty yards long and half a foot deep, was filled with
          small sticks and twigs, mostly of tamarind, which were kindled and
          kept burning till they sank into a mass of glowing embers. Along
          this the devotees, often fifty or sixty in succession, walked, ran,
          or leaped barefoot. In 1854 the Madras Government instituted an
          enquiry into the custom, but found that it was not attended by
          danger or instances of injury sufficient to call for governmental
          interference.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The French
          traveller Sonnerat has described how, in the eighteenth century,
          the Hindoos celebrated a fire-festival of this sort in honour of
          the god Darma Rajah and his wife <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Drobedé (Draupadi). The festival lasted
          eighteen days, during which all who had vowed to take part in it
          were bound to fast, to practise continence, to sleep on the ground
          without a mat, and to walk on a furnace. On the eighteenth day the
          images of Darma Rajah and his spouse were carried in procession to
          the furnace, and the performers followed dancing, their heads
          crowned with flowers and their bodies smeared with saffron. The
          furnace consisted of a trench about forty feet long, filled with
          hot embers. When the images had been carried thrice round it, the
          worshippers walked over the embers, faster or slower, according to
          the degree of their religious fervour, some carrying their children
          in their arms, others brandishing spears, swords, and standards.
          This part of the ceremony being over, the bystanders hastened to
          rub their foreheads with ashes from the furnace, and to beg from
          the performers the flowers which they had worn in their hair; and
          such as obtained them preserved the flowers carefully. The rite was
          performed in honour of the goddess Drobedé (Draupadi), the heroine
          of the great Indian epic, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Mahabharata</span></span>. For she married
          five brothers all at once; every year she left one of her husbands
          to betake herself to another, but before doing so she had to purify
          herself by fire. There was no fixed date for the celebration of the
          rite, but it could only be held in one of the first three months of
          the year.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=
          "#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> In
          some villages the ceremony is performed annually; in others, which
          cannot afford the expense every year, it is observed either at
          longer intervals, perhaps once in three, seven, ten, or twelve
          years, or only in special emergencies, such as the outbreak of
          smallpox, cholera, or plague. Anybody but a pariah or other person
          of very low degree may take part in the ceremony in fulfilment of a
          vow. For example, if a man suffers from some chronic malady, he may
          vow to Draupadi that, should he be healed of his disease, he will
          walk over the fire at her festival. As a preparation for the
          solemnity he sleeps in the temple and observes a fast. The
          celebration of the rite in any village is believed to protect the
          cattle and the crops and to guard the inhabitants from dangers of
          all kinds. When it is over, many people carry <span class=

          to be singed after the passage through the fire-pit, it is an ill

          According to another account the ceremony among the Badagas was
          performed every second year at a harvest festival, and the
          performers were a set of degenerate Brahmans called Haruvarus, who
          <span class="tei tei-q">“used to walk on burning coals with bare
          feet, pretending that the god they worshipped could allay the heat
          and make fire like cold water to them. As they only remained a few

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Japan the
          fire-walk is performed as a religious rite twice a year at a temple
          in the Kanda quarter of Tokio. One of the performances takes place
          in September. It was witnessed in the year 1903 by the wife of an
          American naval officer, who has described it. In a court of the
          temple a bed of charcoal about six yards long, two yards wide, and
          two feet deep was laid down and covered with a deep layer of straw.
          Being ignited, the straw blazed up, and when the flames had died
          down the bed of hot charcoal was fanned by attendants into a red
          glow. Priests dressed in robes of white cotton then walked round
          the fire, striking sparks from flint and steel and carrying trays
          full of salt. When mats had been laid down at the two ends of the
          fire and salt poured on them, the priests rubbed their bare feet
          twice in the salt and then walked calmly down the middle of the
          fire. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the island of
          Mbengga, one of the Fijian archipelago, once every year a dracaena,
          which grows in profusion on the grassy hillsides, becomes fit to
          yield the sugar of which its fibrous root is full. To render the
          roots edible it is necessary to bake them among hot stones for four
          days. A great pit is dug and filled with great stones and blazing
          logs, and when the flames have died down and the stones are at
          white heat, the oven is ready to receive the roots. At this moment
          the members of a certain clan called Na Ivilankata, favoured of the
          gods, leap into the oven and walk unharmed upon the hot stones,
          which would scorch the feet of any other persons. On one occasion
          when the ceremony was witnessed by Europeans fifteen men of the
          clan, dressed in garlands and fringes, walked unscathed through the
          furnace, where tongues of fire played among the hot stones. The pit
          was about nineteen feet wide and the men marched round it, planting
          their feet squarely and firmly on each stone. When they emerged
          from the pit, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg
          011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the feet of several were examined and shewed no trace of scorching;
          even the anklets of dried tree-fern leaves which they wore on their
          legs were unburnt. The immunity thus enjoyed by members of the clan
          in the fiery furnace is explained by a legend that in former days a
          chief of the clan, named Tui Nkualita, received for himself and his
          descendants this remarkable privilege from a certain god, whom the
          chief had accidentally dragged out of a deep pool of water by the

          their sheep at certain times through the fire. Early in the day
          appointed by a kraal for the observance of this custom, the women
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name=
          "Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> milk all their cows,
          and set the whole produce before their husbands. 'Tis a strict rule
          at those times that the women neither taste, nor suffer their
          children to touch, a drop of it. The whole quantity is sacred to
          the men, who drink it all up before they address themselves to the
          business of the fire. Having consumed the milk, some go and bring
          the sheep together to the place where the fire is to be lighted,
          while others repair to the place to light it. The fire is made of
          chips and dry twigs and thinly spread into a long square. Upon the
          coming up of the sheep, the fire, scattered into this figure, is
          covered with green twigs to raise a great smoak; and a number of
          men range themselves closely on both sides of it, making a lane for
          the sheep to pass through, and extending themselves to a good
          distance beyond the fire on the side where the sheep are to enter.
          Things being in this posture, the sheep are driven into the lane
          close up to the fire, which now smoaks in the thickest clouds. The
          foremost boggle, and being forced forward by the press behind, seek
          their escape by attempting breaches in the ranks. The men stand
          close and firm, and whoop and goad them forward; when a few hands,
          planted at the front of the fire, catch three or four of the
          foremost sheep by the head, and drag them through, and bring them
          round into the sight of the rest; which sometimes upon this, the
          whooping and goading continuing, follow with a tantivy, jumping and
          pouring themselves through the fire and smoak with a mighty
          clattering and fury. At other times they are not so tractable, but
          put the Hottentots to the trouble of dragging numbers of them
          through; and sometimes, in a great press and fright, sturdily
          attacking the ranks, they make a breach and escape. This is a very
          mortifying event at all times, the Hottentots, upon whatever
          account, looking upon it as a heavy disgrace and a very ill omen
          into the bargain. But when their labours here are attended with
          such success, that the sheep pass readily through or over the fire,
          'tis hardly in the power of language to describe them in all the
          sallies of their joy.”</span> The writer who thus describes the
          custom had great difficulty in extracting an explanation of it from
          the Hottentots. At last one of them informed him that their country
          was much infested by wild dogs, which made terrible <span class=

          will not be fond of attacking them while the scent of the smoak
          remains upon their fleeces. We therefore from time to time, for the
          security of our flocks, perform this <span class=

          at the foot of Mount Soracte, in Italy, there was a sanctuary of a
          goddess Feronia, where once a year the men of certain families
          walked barefoot, but unscathed, over the glowing embers and ashes
          of a great fire of pinewood in presence of a vast multitude, who
          had assembled from all the country round about to pay their
          devotions to the deity or to ply their business at the fair. The
          families from whom the performers of the rite were drawn went by
          the name of Hirpi Sorani, or <span class="tei tei-q">“Soranian
          Wolves”</span>; and in consideration of the services which they
          rendered the state by walking through the fire, they were exempted,
          by a special decree of the senate, from military service and all
          public burdens. In the discharge of their sacred function, if we
          can trust the testimony of Strabo, they were believed to be
          inspired by the goddess Feronia. The ceremony certainly took place
          in her sanctuary, which was held in the highest reverence alike by
          Latins and Sabines; but according to Virgil and Pliny the rite was
          performed in honour of the god of the mountain, whom they call by
          the Greek name of Apollo, but whose real name appears to have been
          Soranus.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href=

          might perhaps conclude that the passage of his priests through the
          fire was a magical ceremony designed to procure a due supply of
          light and warmth for the earth by mimicking the sun's passage
          across the firmament. For so priceless a service, rendered at some
          personal risk, it would be natural that the magicians should be
          handsomely rewarded by a grateful country, and that they should be
          released from the common obligations of earth in order the better
          to devote themselves to their celestial mission. The neighbouring
          towns paid the first-fruits of their harvest as tribute to the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
          customs, observed in many different parts of the world, present at
          least a superficial resemblance to the modern European practices of
          leaping over fires and driving cattle through them; and we
          naturally ask whether it is not possible to discover a general
          explanation which will include them all. We have seen that two
          general theories have been proposed to account for the European
          practices; according to one theory the customs in question are
          sun-charms, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg
          016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          according to the other they are purifications. Let us see how the
          two rival theories fit the other facts which we have just passed in
          review. To take the solar theory first, it is supported, first, by
          a statement that the fires at the Pongol festival in Southern India
          are intended to wake the sun-god or the fire-god from his
          sleep;<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href=
          "#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> and,
          second, by the etymology which connects Soranus, the god of
          Soracte, with the sun.<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href=
          "#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> But
          for reasons which have already been given, neither of these
          arguments carries much weight; and apart from them there appears to
          be nothing in the foregoing customs to suggest that they are
          sun-charms. Nay, some of the customs appear hardly reconcilable
          with such a view. For it is to be observed that the fire-walk is
          frequently practised in India and other tropical countries, where
          as a rule people would more naturally wish to abate than to
          increase the fierce heat of the sun. In Yucatan certainly the
          intention of kindling the bonfires cannot possibly have been to fan
          the solar flames, since one of the principal evils which the
          bonfires were designed to remedy was precisely the excessive heat
          of the sun, which had withered up the maize crops.<a id=
          "noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> Thus
          the solar theory is not strongly supported by any of the facts
          which we are considering, and it is actually inconsistent with some
          of them.</p>

            <div class="tei tei-marginnotetext">
              <span style="font-size: 80%">On the other hand there is much to
              be said for the view that the fire-walk is a form of
              purification, the flames being thought either to burn up or
              repel the powers of evil. Custom of stepping over fire for the
              purpose of getting rid of a ghost. Widows fumigated to free
              them from their husbands' ghosts.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not so with the
          purificatory theory. It is obviously applicable to some of the
          facts, and apparently consistent with them all. Thus we have seen
          that sick men make a vow to walk over the fire, and that sick
          cattle are driven over it. In such cases clearly the intention is
          to cleanse the suffering man or beast from the infection of
          disease, and thereby to restore him or it to health; and the fire
          is supposed to effect this salutary end, either by burning up the
          powers of evil or by interposing an insurmountable barrier between
          them and the sufferer. For it is to be remembered that evils which
          civilized men regard as impersonal are often conceived by
          uncivilized man in the personal shape of witches and wizards, of
          ghosts and hobgoblins; so that measures which we should consider as
          simple disinfectants the savage looks upon as obstacles opportunely
          presented to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg
          017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the attacks of demons or other uncanny beings. Now of all such
          obstacles fire seems generally to be thought the most effective;
          hence in passing through or leaping over it our primitive
          philosopher often imagines that he is not so much annihilating his
          spiritual foe as merely giving him the slip; the ghostly pursuer
          shrinks back appalled at the flames through which his intended
          victim, driven to desperation by his fears, has safely passed
          before him. This interpretation of the ceremony is confirmed,
          first, by the observation that in India the ashes of the bonfire
          are used as a talisman against devils and demons;<a id="noteref_32"
          name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> and,
          second, by the employment of the ceremony for the avowed purpose of
          escaping from the pursuit of a troublesome ghost. For example, in
          China <span class="tei tei-q">“they believe that a beheaded man
          wanders about a headless spectre in the World of Shades. Such
          spectres are frequently to be seen in walled towns, especially in
          the neighbourhood of places of execution. Here they often visit the
          people with disease and disaster, causing a considerable
          depreciation in the value of the houses around such scenes.
          Whenever an execution takes place, the people fire crackers to
          frighten the headless ghost away from the spot; and the mandarin
          who has superintended the bloody work, on entering the gate of his
          mansion, has himself carried in his sedan chair over a fire lighted
          on the pavement, lest the headless apparition should enter there
          along with him; for disembodied spirits are afraid of
          fire.”</span><a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href=
          "#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> For a
          like reason Chinese mourners after a funeral, and persons who have
          paid a visit of condolence to a house of death, often purify
          themselves by stepping over a fire of straw;<a id="noteref_34"
          name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> the
          purification, we cannot doubt, consists simply in shaking off the
          ghost who is supposed to dog their steps. Similarly at a coroner's
          inquest in China the mandarin and his subordinates hold pocket
          handkerchiefs or towels to their mouths and noses while they are
          inspecting the corpse, no doubt to hinder the ghost from
          insinuating himself into their bodies by these apertures; and when
          they have discharged their dangerous <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> duty, they purify themselves by passing
          through a small fire of straw kindled on the pavement before they
          enter their sedan-chairs to return home, while at the same time the
          crowd of idlers, who have gathered about the door, assist in
          keeping the ghost at bay by a liberal discharge of crackers. The
          same double process of purification, or rather of repelling the
          ghost, by means of fire and crackers is repeated at the gate of the
          mandarin's residence when the procession defiles into it.<a id=

              <span style="font-size: 80%">Hence it seems probable that the
              chief use of the fire in the fire-festivals of Europe was to
              destroy or repel the witches, to whose maleficent arts the

          of these customs, in which the purpose of the passage through the
          fire appears to be unmistakable, we may suppose that the motive of
          the rite is similar at the popular festivals of Europe and the like
          observances in other lands. In every case the ritual appears to be
          explained in a simple and natural way by the supposition that the
          performers believe themselves to be freed from certain evils,
          actual or threatened, through the beneficent agency of fire, which
          either burns up and destroys the noxious things or at all events
          repels and keeps them at bay. Indeed this belief, or at least this
          hope, is definitely expressed by some of the people who leap across
          the bonfires: they imagine that all ills are burnt up and consumed
          in the flames, or that they leave their sins, or at all events
          their fleas, behind them on the far side of the fire.<a id=

          may conjecture that originally all the evils from which the people
          thus thought to deliver themselves were conceived by them to be
          caused by personal beings, such as ghosts and demons or witches and
          warlocks, and that the fires were kindled for the sole purpose of
          burning or banning these noxious creatures. Of these evil powers
          witches and warlocks appear to have been the most dreaded by our
          European peasantry; and it is therefore significant that the fires
          kindled on these occasions are often expressly alleged to burn the
          witches,<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href=

          May Day and Midsummer Eve, coincide with the seasons when witches

          clearly as day follows night that to jump over a fire must be a
          sovereign panacea for practically all the ills that flesh is heir
          to. We can now, perhaps, fully understand why festivals of fire
          played so prominent a part in the religion or superstition of our
          heathen forefathers; the observance of such festivals flowed
          directly from their overmastering fear of witchcraft and from their

          ask, What is the meaning of burning effigies in the fire at these

          question seems obvious. As the fires are often alleged to be
          kindled for the purpose of burning the witches, and as the effigy
          burnt in them is sometimes called <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Witch,”</span> we might naturally be disposed to conclude that all
          the effigies consumed in the flames on these occasions represent
          witches or warlocks, and that the custom of burning them is merely
          a substitute for burning the wicked men and women themselves, since
          on the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic you practically
          destroy the witch herself in destroying her effigy. On the whole
          this explanation of the burning of straw figures in human shape at
          the festivals appears to be the most probable.</p>

          effigy in these bonfires? The effigies so burned, as I have already
          remarked, can hardly be separated from the effigies of Death which
          are burned or otherwise destroyed in spring; and grounds have been
          already given for regarding the so-called effigies of Death as
          really representatives of the tree-spirit <span class="tei tei-pb"

          the other effigies, which are burned in the spring and midsummer
          bonfires, susceptible of the same explanation? It would seem so.
          For just as the fragments of the so-called Death are stuck in the
          fields to make the crops grow, so the charred embers of the figure
          burned in the spring bonfires are sometimes laid on the fields in
          the belief that they will keep vermin from the crop.<a id=

          the rule that the last married bride must leap over the fire in
          which the straw-man is burned on Shrove Tuesday, is probably

          therefore a fair presumption that the burning effigy over which the
          bride must leap is a representative of the fertilizing tree-spirit
          or spirit of vegetation. This character of the effigy, as
          representative of the spirit of vegetation, is almost unmistakable
          when the figure is composed of an unthreshed sheaf of corn or is
          covered from head to foot with flowers.<a id="noteref_50" name=

          it is to be noted that, instead of a puppet, trees, either living
          or felled, are sometimes burned both in the spring and midsummer

          considering the frequency with which the tree-spirit is represented
          in human shape, it is hardly rash to suppose that when sometimes a
          tree and sometimes an effigy is burned in these fires, the effigy
          and the tree are regarded as equivalent to each other, each being a
          representative of the tree-spirit. This, again, is confirmed by
          observing, first, that sometimes the effigy which is to be burned
          is carried about simultaneously with a May-tree, the former being
          carried by the boys, the latter by the girls;<a id="noteref_52"
          name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> and,
          second, that the effigy is sometimes tied to a living tree and
          burned with it.<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href=
          "#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> In
          these cases, we can scarcely doubt, the tree-spirit is represented,
          as we have found it represented before, in duplicate, both by the
          tree and by the effigy. That the true character of the effigy as a
          representative of the beneficent spirit of vegetation should
          sometimes be forgotten, is natural. The custom of burning
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name=
          "Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a beneficent god is
          too foreign to later modes of thought to escape misinterpretation.
          Naturally enough the people who continued to burn his image came in
          time to identify it as the effigy of persons, whom, on various
          grounds, they regarded with aversion, such as Judas Iscariot,
          Luther, and a witch.</span></p>

          when the god happens to be a deity of vegetation, there are special
          reasons why he should die by fire. For light and heat are necessary
          to vegetable growth; and, on the principle of sympathetic magic, by
          subjecting the personal representative of vegetation to their
          influence, you secure a supply of these necessaries for trees and
          crops. In other words, by burning the spirit of vegetation in a
          fire which represents the sun, you make sure that, for a time at
          least, vegetation shall have plenty of sun. It may be objected
          that, if the intention is simply to secure enough sunshine for
          vegetation, this end would be better attained, on the principles of
          sympathetic magic, by merely passing the representative of
          vegetation through the fire instead of burning him. In point of
          fact this is sometimes done. In Russia, as we have seen, the straw
          figure of Kupalo is not burned in the midsummer fire, but merely
          carried backwards and forwards across it.<a id="noteref_55" name=
          "noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> But,
          for the reasons already given, it is necessary that the god should
          die; so next day Kupalo is stripped of her ornaments and thrown
          into a stream. In this Russian custom, therefore, the passage of
          the image through the fire is a sun-charm pure and simple; the
          killing of the god is a separate act, and the mode of killing
          him—by drowning—is probably a rain-charm. But usually people have
          not thought it necessary to draw this fine distinction; for the
          various reasons already assigned, it is advantageous, they think,
          to expose the god of vegetation to a considerable degree of heat,
          and it is also advantageous to kill him, and they combine these
          advantages in a rough-and-ready way by burning him.”</span></p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the foregoing
          argument, which I do not now find very cogent, I would remark that
          we must distinguish the cases in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> which an effigy or an image is burnt in the
          fire from the cases in which it is simply carried through or over
          it. We have seen that in the Chinese festival of fire the image of
          the god is carried thrice by bearers over the glowing furnace. Here
          the motive for subjecting a god to the heat of the furnace must
          surely be the same as the motive for subjecting his worshippers to
          the same ordeal; and if the motive in the case of the worshippers
          is purificatory, it is probably the same in the case of the deity.
          In other words we may suppose that the image of a god is
          periodically carried over a furnace in order to purify him from the
          taint of corruption, the spells of magicians, or any other evil
          influences that might impair or impede his divine energies. The
          same theory would explain the custom of obliging the priest
          ceremonially to pass through the fire; the custom need not be a
          mitigation of an older practice of burning him in the flames, it
          may only be a purification designed to enable him the better to
          discharge his sacred duties as representative of the deity in the
          coming year. Similarly, when the rite is obligatory, not on the
          people as a whole, but only on certain persons chosen for the
          purpose,<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href=
          "#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> we may
          suppose that these persons act as representatives of the entire
          community, which thus passes through the fire by deputy and
          consequently participates in all the benefits which are believed to
          accrue from the purificatory character of the rite.<a id=

          both cases, therefore, if my interpretation of them is correct, the
          passage over or through a fire is not a substitute for human
          sacrifice; it is nothing but a stringent form of purification.</p>

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> point to a former practice of human
          sacrifice. We have seen reasons for believing that in Europe living
          persons have often acted as representatives of the tree-spirit and
          corn-spirit and have suffered death as such.<a id="noteref_58"

          is no reason, therefore, why they should not have been burned, if
          any special advantages were likely to be attained by putting them
          to death in that way. The consideration of human suffering is not
          one which enters into the calculations of primitive man. Now, in
          the fire-festivals which we are discussing, the pretence of burning
          people is sometimes carried so far that it seems reasonable to
          regard it as a mitigated survival of an older custom of actually
          burning them. Thus in Aachen, as we saw, the man clad in peas-straw
          acts so cleverly that the children really believe he is being
          burned.<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href=
          "#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Jumièges in Normandy the man clad all in green, who bore the title
          of the Green Wolf, was pursued by his comrades, and when they
          caught him they feigned to fling him upon the mid-summer
          bonfire.<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href=

          Similarly at the Beltane fires in Scotland the pretended victim was
          seized, and a show made of throwing him into the flames, and for
          some time afterwards people affected to speak of him as dead.<a id=

          in the Hallowe'en bonfires of north-eastern Scotland we may perhaps
          detect a similar pretence in the custom observed by a lad of lying
          down as close to the fire as possible and allowing the other lads
          to leap over him.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href=

          In the following customs Mannhardt is probably right in recognizing
          traces of an old custom of burning a leaf-clad representative of
          the spirit of vegetation. At Wolfeck, in Austria, on Midsummer Day,
          a boy completely clad in green fir branches goes from house to

          the majestic ruins of Heidelberg castle, the spirit of the river
          seeks to drown three persons, one on Midsummer Eve, one on
          Midsummer Day, and one on the day after. On these nights, if you
          hear a shriek as of a drowning man or woman from the water, beware
          of running to the rescue; for it is only the water-fairy shrieking
          to lure you to your doom. Many a fisherman of the Elbe knows better
          than to launch his boat and trust himself to the treacherous river
          on Midsummer Day. And Samland fishermen will not go to sea at this
          season, because they are aware that the sea is then hollow and
          demands a victim. In the neighbourhood of the Lake of Constance
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name=
          "Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Swabian peasants
          say that on St. John's Day the Angel or St. John must have a
          swimmer and a climber; hence no one will climb a tree or bathe even
          in a brook on that day.<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href=
          "#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>
          According to others, St. John will have three dead men on his day;
          one of them must die by water, one by a fall, and one by lightning;
          therefore old-fashioned people warn their children not to climb or
          bathe, and are very careful themselves not to run into any kind of
          danger on Midsummer Day.<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href=
          "#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a> So in
          some parts of Switzerland people are warned against bathing on St.
          John's Night, because the saint's day demands its victims. Thus in
          the Emmenthal they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“This day will have
          three persons; one must perish in the air, one in the fire, and the
          third in the water.”</span> At Schaffhausen the saying runs,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“St. John the Baptist must have a runner,
          must have a swimmer, must have a climber.”</span> That is the
          reason why you should not climb cherry-trees on the saint's day,
          lest you should fall down and break your valuable neck.<a id=
          "noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> In
          Cologne the saint is more exacting; on his day he requires no less
          than fourteen dead men; seven of them must be swimmers and seven
          climbers.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href=

          Accordingly when we find that, in one of the districts where a
          belief of this sort prevails, it used to be customary to throw a
          person into the water on Midsummer Day, we can hardly help
          concluding that this was only a modification of an older custom of
          actually drowning a human being in the river at that time. In
          Voigtland it was formerly the practice to set up a fine May tree,
          adorned with all kinds of things, on St. John's Day. The people
          danced round it, and when the lads had fetched down the things with
          which it was tricked out, the tree was thrown into the water. But
          before this was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg
          028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          done, they sought out somebody whom they treated in the same
          manner, and the victim of this horseplay was called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the John.”</span> The brawls and disorders, which such
          a custom naturally provoked, led to the suppression of the whole
          ceremony.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href=
          "#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Rotenburg on

          Clearly, therefore, the loaf is regarded as a substitute which the
          spirit of the river consents to accept instead of a human victim.
          Elsewhere the water-sprite is content with flowers. Thus in Bohemia
          people sometimes cast garlands into water on Midsummer Eve; and if
          the water-sprite pulls one of them down, it is a sign that the
          person who threw the garland in will die.<a id="noteref_73" name=

          villages of Hesse the girl who first comes to the well early on the
          morning of Midsummer Day, places on the mouth of the well a gay
          garland composed of many sorts of flowers which she has culled from
          the fields and meadows. Sometimes a number of such garlands are
          twined together to form a crown, with which the well is decked. At
          Fulda, in addition to the flowery decoration of the wells, the
          neighbours choose a Lord of the Wells and announce his election by
          sending him a great nosegay of flowers; his house, too, is
          decorated with green boughs, and children walk in procession to it.
          He goes from house to house collecting materials for a feast, of
          which the neighbours partake on the following Sunday.<a id=

          Sicilian mothers on that ominous day warn their little sons not to
          go out of the house, or, if they do go out, not to stray far, not
          to walk on solitary unfrequented paths, to avoid horses and
          carriages and persons with firearms, and not to dare to swim; in
          short they bid them be on their guard at every turn. The Sicilian
          writer who tells us this adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“This I know
          and sadly remember ever since the year 1848, when, not yet seven
          years old, I beheld in the dusk of the evening on St. John's Day
          some women of my acquaintance bringing back in their arms my little
          brother, who had gone to play in a garden near our house, and there
          had found his death, my poor Francesco! In their simplicity the
          women who strove to console my inconsolable mother, driven
          distracted by the dreadful blow, kept repeating that St. John must
          have his due, that on that day he must be appeased. <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet curiously
          enough, though the water-spirits call for human victims on
          Midsummer Eve or Midsummer Day, water in general is supposed at
          that season to acquire certain wonderful medicinal virtues, so that
          he who bathes in it then or drinks of it is not only healed of all
          his infirmities but will be well and hearty throughout the year.
          Hence in many parts of Europe, from Sweden in the north to Sicily
          in the south, and from Ireland and Spain in the west to Esthonia in
          the east it used to be customary for men, women, and children to
          bathe in crowds in rivers, the sea, or springs on Midsummer Eve or
          Midsummer Day, hoping thus to fortify themselves for the next
          twelve months. The usual time for taking the bath was the night
          which intervenes between Midsummer Eve and Midsummer Day;<a id=

          hour was noon on Midsummer Day. It was a curious sight, we are
          told, to see the banks of a river lined with naked children waiting
          for the first stroke of noon to plunge into the healing water. The
          dip was supposed to have a remarkable effect in strengthening the
          legs. People who were ashamed to bathe in public used to have cans
          of water brought to their houses from the river at midday, and then
          performed their ablutions in the privacy of their chambers. Nor did
          they throw away the precious fluid; on the contrary they bottled it
          up and kept it as a sort of elixir for use throughout the year. It
          was thought never to grow foul and to be as blessed as holy water
          fetched from a church, which we may well believe. Hence it served
          to guard the house against a thunder-storm; when the clouds were
          heavy and threatening, all you had to do was to take the palm
          branches (that is, the twigs of box-wood) which were blessed on
          Palm Sunday, dip them in the midsummer water, and burn them. That
          averted the tempest.<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href=

          marvellous virtue that it not only heals but prevents sickness for
          the rest of the year; hence men, women, and children bathe in the

          that, in the Andjra they bathe their animals also; horses, mules,
          donkeys, cattle, sheep, and goats, all must participate in the

          the aim of bathing in the midsummer water is undoubtedly
          purification, it is reasonable to assign the same motive for the
          custom of leaping over the midsummer bonfire. On the other hand
          some people in Morocco, like some people in Europe, think that
          water on Midsummer Day is unclean or dangerous. A Berber told Dr.
          Westermarck that water is haunted on Midsummer Day, and that people
          therefore avoid bathing in it and keep animals from drinking of it.
          And among the Beni Ahsen persons who swim in the river on that day
          are careful, before plunging into the water, to throw burning straw
          into it as an offering, in order that the spirits may not harm
          them.<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href=

          the traces of human sacrifice which we have detected in the rite of
          water may therefore be allowed to strengthen the inference of a
          similar sacrifice in the rite of fire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it seems
          possible to go farther than this. Of human sacrifices offered on
          these occasions the most unequivocal traces, as we have seen, are
          those which, about a hundred years ago, still lingered at the
          Beltane fires in the Highlands of Scotland, that is, among a Celtic
          people who, situated in a remote corner of Europe and almost
          completely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg
          032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          isolated from foreign influence, had till then conserved their old
          heathenism better perhaps than any other people in the West of
          Europe. It is significant, therefore, that human sacrifices by fire
          are known, on unquestionable evidence, to have been systematically
          practised by the Celts. The earliest description of these
          sacrifices has been bequeathed to us by Julius Caesar. As conqueror
          of the hitherto independent Celts of Gaul, Caesar had ample
          opportunity of observing the national Celtic religion and manners,
          while these were still fresh and crisp from the native mint and had
          not yet been fused in the melting-pot of Roman civilization. With
          his own notes Caesar appears to have incorporated the observations
          of a Greek explorer, by name Posidonius, who travelled in Gaul
          about fifty years before Caesar carried the Roman arms to the
          English Channel. The Greek geographer Strabo and the historian
          Diodorus seem also to have derived their descriptions of the Celtic
          sacrifices from the work of Posidonius, but independently of each
          other, and of Caesar, for each of the three derivative accounts
          contain some details which are not to be found in either of the
          others. By combining them, therefore, we can restore the original
          account of Posidonius with some probability, and thus obtain a
          picture of the sacrifices offered by the Celts of Gaul at the close
          of the second century before our era.<a id="noteref_84" name=

          following seem to have been the main outlines of the custom.
          Condemned criminals were reserved by the Celts in order to be
          sacrificed to the gods at a great festival which took place once in
          every five years. The more there were of such victims, the greater
          was believed to be the fertility of the land.<a id="noteref_85"

          there were not enough criminals to furnish victims, captives taken
          in war were immolated to supply the deficiency. When the time came
          the victims were sacrificed by the Druids or priests. Some they
          shot down with arrows, some they impaled, and some they burned
          alive in the following manner. Colossal images of <span class=

          constructed; these were filled with live men, cattle, and animals

          quinquennial festivals, celebrated on so grand a scale, and with,
          apparently, so large an expenditure of human life, it seems
          reasonable to suppose that festivals of the same sort, only on a
          lesser scale, were held annually, and that from these annual
          festivals are lineally descended some at least of the
          fire-festivals which, with their traces of human sacrifices, are
          still celebrated year by year in many parts of Europe. The gigantic
          images constructed of osiers or covered with grass in which the
          Druids enclosed their victims remind us of the leafy framework in
          which the human representative of the tree-spirit is still so often
          encased.<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href=

          seeing that the fertility of the land was apparently supposed to

          interpreted the Celtic victims, cased in osiers and grass, as
          representatives of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation.</p>

          giants of the Druids seem to have had till lately their
          representatives at the spring and midsummer festivals of modern
          Europe. At Douay, down to the early part of the nineteenth century,
          a procession took place annually on the Sunday nearest to the
          seventh of July. The great feature of the procession was a colossal
          figure, some twenty or thirty feet high, made of osiers, and called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the giant,”</span> which was moved through
          the streets by means of rollers and ropes worked by men who were
          enclosed within the effigy. The wooden head of the giant is said to
          have been carved and painted by Rubens. The figure was armed as a
          knight with lance and sword, helmet and shield. Behind him marched
          his wife and his three children, all constructed of osiers on the
          same principle, but on a smaller scale.<a id="noteref_87" name=

          procession of the giants took place on Midsummer Day, the
          twenty-fourth of June. The festival, which was known as the Follies
          of Dunkirk, attracted such multitudes of spectators, that the inns
          and private houses could not lodge them all, and many had to sleep
          in cellars or in the streets. In 1755 an eye-witness estimated that
          the number of onlookers was not less than forty thousand, without
          counting the inhabitants of the town. The streets through which the
          procession took its way were lined with double ranks of soldiers,
          and the houses crammed with spectators from top to bottom. High
          mass was celebrated in the principal church and then the procession
          got under weigh. First came the guilds or brotherhoods, the members
          walking two and two with great waxen tapers, lighted, in their
          hands. They were followed by the friars and the secular priests,
          and then came the Abbot, magnificently attired, with the Host borne
          before him by a venerable old man. When these were past, the real
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Follies of Dunkirk”</span> began. They
          consisted of pageants of various sorts wheeled through the streets
          in cars. These appear to have varied somewhat from year to year;
          but if we may judge from the processions of 1755 and 1757, both of
          which have been described by eye-witnesses, a standing show was a
          car decked with foliage and branches to imitate a wood, and
          carrying a number of men dressed in leaves or in green scaly skins,
          who squirted water on the people from pewter syringes. An English
          spectator has compared these maskers to the Green Men of our own
          country on May Day. Last of all came the giant and giantess. The
          giant was a huge figure of wicker-work, occasionally as much as
          forty-five feet high, dressed in a long blue robe with gold
          stripes, which reached to his feet, concealing the dozen or more
          men who made it dance and bob its head to the spectators. This
          colossal effigy went by the name of Papa <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Reuss, and carried in its pocket a bouncing
          infant of Brobdingnagian proportions, who kept bawling <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Papa! papa!”</span> in a voice of thunder, only
          pausing from time to time to devour the victuals which were handed
          out to him from the windows. The rear was brought up by the
          daughter of the giant, constructed, like her sire, of wicker-work,
          and little, if at all, inferior to him in size. She wore a
          rose-coloured robe, with a gold watch as large as a warming pan at
          her side: her breast glittered with jewels: her complexion was
          high, and her eyes and head turned with as easy a grace as the men
          inside could contrive to impart to their motions. The procession
          came to an end with the revolution of 1789, and has never been
          revived. The giant himself indeed, who had won the affections of
          the townspeople, survived his ancient glory for a little while and
          made shift to appear in public a few times more at the Carnival and
          other festal occasions; but his days were numbered, and within
          fifty years even his memory had seemingly perished.<a id=

          of the populace, who loved these grotesque figures, spoke of them
          with patriotic enthusiasm, and never wearied of gazing at them. The
          name by which the giants went was Reuzes, and a special song called
          the Reuze song was sung in the Flemish dialect while they were
          making their triumphal progress through the streets. The most
          celebrated of these monstrous effigies were those of Antwerp and
          Wetteren. At Ypres a whole family of giants contributed to the
          public hilarity at the Carnival. At Cassel and Hazebrouch, in the

          on Shrove Tuesday.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href=

          Ath, in the Belgian province of Hainaut, the popular procession of
          the giants took place annually in August down to the year 1869 at

          twenty bearers concealed under the flowing drapery of the giants,
          to the great delight of the townspeople and a crowd of strangers
          who assembled to witness the pageant. The custom can be traced back
          by documentary evidence to the middle of the fifteenth century; but
          it appears that the practice of giving Goliath a wife dates only
          from the year 1715. Their nuptials were solemnized every year on
          the eve of the festival in the church of St. Julien, whither the

          Chester the annual pageant on Midsummer Eve included the effigies
          of four giants, with animals, hobby-horses, and other figures. An
          officious mayor of the town suppressed the giants in 1599, but they
          were restored by another mayor in 1601. Under the Commonwealth the
          pageant was discontinued, and the giants and beasts were destroyed;
          but after the restoration of Charles II. the old ceremony was
          revived on the old date, new effigies being constructed to replace
          those which had fallen victims to Roundhead bigotry. The accounts
          preserve a record not only of the hoops, buckram, tinfoil, gold and
          silver leaf, paint, glue, and paste which went to make up these
          gorgeous figures; they also mention the arsenic which was mixed
          with the paste in order to preserve the poor giants from being
          eaten alive by the rats.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href=

          Burford, in Oxfordshire, Midsummer Eve used to be celebrated with
          great jollity by the carrying of a giant and a dragon up and down
          the town. The last survivor of these perambulating English giants
          dragged out a miserable existence at Salisbury, where an antiquary
          found him mouldering to decay in the neglected hall of the Tailors'
          Company about the year 1844. His bodily framework was of lath and
          hoop like the one which used to be worn by Jack-in-the-Green on May
          Day. The drapery, which concealed the bearer, was of coloured
          chintz, bordered with red and purple, and trimmed with yellow
          fringe. His head was modelled in paste-board and adorned with a
          gold-laced cocked hat: his flowing locks were of tow; and in his
          big right hand he brandished a branch of <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=

          he promenaded about the streets, dancing clumsily and attended by
          two men grotesquely attired, who kept a watchful eye on his
          movements and checked by the wooden sword and club which they
          carried any incipient tendency to lose his balance and topple over
          in an undignified manner, which would have exposed to the derision
          of the populace the mystery of his inner man. The learned called

          was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats,
          which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire;
          sometimes a fox was burned. The people collected the embers and
          ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought
          good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and
          even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 Louis the
          Fourteenth, crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of
          roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of
          the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last

              of modern Europe.</span>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
          that the sacrificial rites of the Celts of ancient Gaul can be
          traced in the popular festivals of modern Europe. Naturally it is
          in France, or rather in the wider area comprised within the limits
          of ancient Gaul, that these rites have left the clearest traces in
          the customs of burning giants of wicker-work and animals enclosed
          in wicker-work or baskets. These customs, it will have been
          remarked, are generally observed at or about midsummer. From this
          we may infer that the original rites of which these are the
          degenerate successors were solemnized at midsummer. This inference
          harmonizes with the conclusion suggested by a general survey of
          European folk-custom, that the midsummer festival must on the whole
          have been the most widely diffused and the most solemn of all the
          yearly festivals celebrated by the primitive Aryans in Europe. At
          the same time we must bear in mind that among the British Celts the
          chief fire-festivals of the year appear certainly to have been
          those <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name=
          "Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Beltane (May Day)
          and Hallowe'en (the last day of October); and this suggests a doubt
          whether the Celts of Gaul also may not have celebrated their
          principal rites of fire, including their burnt sacrifices of men
          and animals, at the beginning of May or the beginning of November
          rather than at Midsummer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have still to
          ask, What is the meaning of such sacrifices? Why were men and
          animals burnt to death at these festivals? If we are right in
          interpreting the modern European fire-festivals as attempts to
          break the power of witchcraft by burning or banning the witches and
          warlocks, it seems to follow that we must explain the human
          sacrifices of the Celts in the same manner; that is, we must
          suppose that the men whom the Druids burnt in wicker-work images
          were condemned to death on the ground that they were witches or
          wizards, and that the mode of execution by fire was chosen because,
          as we have seen, burning alive is deemed the surest mode of getting
          rid of these noxious and dangerous beings. The same explanation
          would apply to the cattle and wild animals of many kinds which the
          Celts burned along with the men.<a id="noteref_107" name=

          too, we may conjecture, were supposed to be either under the spell
          of witchcraft or actually to be the witches and wizards, who had
          transformed themselves into animals for the purpose of prosecuting
          their infernal plots against the welfare of their fellow creatures.
          This conjecture is confirmed by the observation that the victims
          most commonly burned in modern bonfires have been cats, and that
          cats are precisely the animals into which, with the possible
          exception of hares, witches were most usually supposed to transform
          themselves. Again, we have seen that serpents and foxes used
          sometimes to be burnt in the midsummer fires;<a id="noteref_108"

          seems easy on this hypothesis to account for the variety of living
          creatures that have been burnt at festivals both in ancient Gaul
          and modern Europe; all these victims, we may surmise, were doomed
          to the flames, not because they were animals, but because they were
          believed to be witches who had taken the shape of animals for their
          nefarious purposes. One advantage of explaining the ancient Celtic
          sacrifices in this way is that it introduces, as it were, a harmony
          and consistency into the treatment which Europe has meted out to
          witches from the earliest times down to about two centuries ago,
          when the growing influence of rationalism discredited the belief in
          witchcraft and put a stop to the custom of burning witches. On this
          view the Christian Church in its dealings with the black art merely
          carried out the traditional policy of Druidism, and it might be a
          nice question to decide which of the two, in pursuance of that
          policy, exterminated the larger number of innocent men and
          women.<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href=

              <span style="font-size: 80%">Mannhardt thought that the men and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Druidical
          sacrifices which we are considering were explained in a different
          way by W. Mannhardt. He supposed that the men whom the Druids
          burned in wickerwork images represented the spirits of vegetation,
          and accordingly that the custom of burning them was a magical
          ceremony intended to secure the necessary sunshine for the crops.
          Similarly, he seems to have inclined to the view that the animals
          which used to be burnt in the bonfires represented the
          corn-spirit,<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href=

          which, as we saw in an earlier part of this work, is often supposed
          to assume the shape of an animal.<a id="noteref_114" name=

          theory is no doubt tenable, and the great authority of W. Mannhardt
          entitles it to careful consideration. I adopted it in former
          editions of this book; but on reconsideration it seems to me on the
          whole to be less probable than the theory that the men and animals
          burnt in the fires perished in the character of witches. This
          latter view is strongly supported by the testimony of the people
          who celebrate the fire-festivals, since a popular name for the
          custom of kindling the fires is <span class="tei tei-q">“burning
          the witches,”</span> effigies of witches are sometimes consumed in
          the flames, and the fires, their embers, or their ashes are
          supposed to furnish protection against witchcraft. On the other
          hand there is little to shew that the effigies or the animals burnt
          in the fires are regarded by the people as representatives of the
          vegetation-spirit, and that the bonfires are sun-charms. With
          regard to serpents in particular, which used to be burnt in the
          midsummer fire at Luchon, I am not aware of any certain evidence
          that in Europe snakes have been regarded as embodiments of the
          tree-spirit or corn-spirit,<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115"

          though in other parts of the world <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Whereas the popular faith in the transformation of witches into
          animals is so general and deeply rooted, and the fear of these
          uncanny beings is so strong, that it seems safer to suppose that

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A feature of the
        great midsummer festival remains to be considered, which may perhaps
        help to clear up the doubt as to the meaning of the fire-ceremonies
        and their relation to Druidism. For in France and England, the
        countries where the sway of the Druids is known to have been most
        firmly established, Midsummer Eve is still the time for culling
        certain magic plants, whose evanescent virtue can be secured at this
        mystic season alone. Indeed all over Europe antique fancies of the
        same sort have lingered about Midsummer Eve, imparting to it a
        fragrance of the past, like withered rose leaves that, found by
        chance in the pages of an old volume, still smell of departed
        summers. Thus in Saintonge and Aunis, two of the ancient provinces of
        Western France, we read that <span class="tei tei-q">“of all the
        festivals for which the merry bells ring out there is not one which
        has given rise to a greater number of superstitious practices than
        the festival of St. John the Baptist. The Eve of St. John was the day
        of all days for gathering the wonderful herbs by means of which you
        could combat fever, cure a host of diseases, and guard yourself
        against sorcerers and their spells. But in order to attain these
        results two conditions had to be observed; first, you must be fasting
        when you gathered the herbs, and second, you must cull them before
        the sun rose. If these conditions were not fulfilled, the plants had
        no special virtue.”</span><a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117"

        to perform certain ceremonies. The plants thus collected were
        carefully kept as an infallible cure for fever; placed above beds and
        the doors of houses and of cattle-sheds they protected man and beast

        of flowers and seeds and leaves gathered, with certain traditional
        rites, on the Eve or the Day of St. John has remained part of the
        peasant's creed to this day. Thus he fancies that seeds of vegetables
        and plants, which have been collected on St. John's Eve, will keep
        better than others, and that flowers plucked that day will never

        herbs, aromatic or otherwise. The folk attribute superstitious
        virtues to these plants; they are persuaded that if they have been

        Eve of St. John (Midsummer Eve), before sunset, the peasants of

        scented flowers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg
        047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> are
        added, and out of the posies they make floral crosses and crowns,
        which they hang up over the doors of houses and stables. Such floral
        decorations are sold like the box-wood on Palm Sunday, and the
        withered wreaths are kept from year to year. If an animal dies, it
        may be a cow, they carefully clean the byre or the stable, make a
        pile of these faded garlands, and set them on fire, having previously

        virtue (<span lang="ar" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "ar"><span style="font-style: italic">baraka</span></span>) when they
        are gathered shortly before midsummer. Hence the people collect these
        plants at this season and preserve them for magical or medical
        purposes. For example, branches of oleander are brought into the
        houses before midsummer and kept under the roof as a charm against
        the evil eye; but while the branches are being brought in they may
        not touch the ground, else they would lose their marvellous
        properties. Cases of sickness caused by the evil eye are cured by
        fumigating the patients with the smoke of these boughs. The greatest
        efficacy is ascribed to <span class="tei tei-q">“the sultan of the
        oleander,”</span> which is a stalk with four pairs of leaves
        clustered round it. Such a stalk is always endowed with magical
        virtue, but that virtue is greatest when the stalk has been cut just
        before midsummer. Arab women in the Hiaina district of Morocco gather
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Daphne
        gnidium</span></span> on Midsummer Day, dry it in the sun, and make
        it into a powder which, mixed with water, they daub on the heads of
        their little children to protect them from sunstroke and vermin and
        to make their hair grow well. Indeed such marvellous powers do these

        another mode of consulting the oracle by means of these same garlands

        the wreath is thrown without sticking to the branches of the tree the

        St. John's Eve and put to a more prosaic use than that of presaging
        the course of true love. They are carefully preserved, and the people
        brew a sort of tea from them, which they administer as a remedy for
        many ailments; or they keep the chaplets under their pillows till

        Esthonia the virtues popularly ascribed to wreaths of this sort are
        many and various. These wreaths, composed of nine kinds of herbs
        culled on the Eve or the Day of St. John, are sometimes inserted in
        the roof or hung up on the walls of the house, and each of them
        receives the name of one of the inmates. If the plants which have
        been thus dedicated to a girl happen to take root and grow in the
        chinks and crannies, she will soon wed; if they have been dedicated
        to an older person and wither away, that person will die. The people
        also give them as medicine to cattle at the time when the animals are
        driven forth to pasture; or they fumigate the beasts with the smoke
        of the herbs, which are burnt along with shavings from the wooden
        threshold. Bunches of the plants are also hung about the house to
        keep off evil <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the flowers
        which it has been customary to gather for purposes of magic or
        divination at midsummer none perhaps is so widely popular as St.
        John's wort (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Hypericum
        perforatum</span></span>). The reason for associating this particular
        plant with the great summer festival is perhaps not far to seek, for
        the flower blooms about Midsummer Day, and with its bright yellow
        petals and masses of golden stamens it might well pass for a tiny
        copy on earth of the great sun which reaches its culminating point in
        heaven at this season. Gathered on Midsummer Eve, or on Midsummer Day
        before sunrise, the blossoms are hung on doorways and windows to
        preserve the house against thunder, witches, and evil spirits; and
        various healing properties are attributed to the different species of
        the plant. In the Tyrol they say that if you put St. John's wort in
        your shoe before sunrise on Midsummer Day you may walk as far as you
        please without growing weary. In Scotland people carried it about
        their persons as an amulet against witchcraft. On the lower Rhine
        children twine chaplets of St. John's wort on the morning of
        Midsummer Day, and throw them on the roofs of the houses. Here, too,
        the people who danced round the midsummer bonfires used <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to wear wreaths of these yellow flowers
        in their hair, and to deck the images of the saints at wayside
        shrines with the blossoms. Sometimes they flung the flowers into the
        bonfires. In Sicily they dip St. John's wort in oil, and so apply it
        as a balm for every wound. During the Middle Ages the power which the
        plant notoriously possesses of banning devils won for it the name of
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">fuga
        daemonum</span></span>; and before witches and wizards were stretched
        on the rack or otherwise tortured, the flower used to be administered
        to them as a means of wringing the truth from their lips.<a id=

        North Wales people used to fix sprigs of St. John's wort over their

        Saintonge and Aunis the flowers served to detect the presence of
        sorcerers, for if one of these pestilent fellows entered a house, the
        bunches of St. John's wort, which had been gathered on Midsummer Eve
        and hung on the walls, immediately dropped their yellow heads as if
        they had suddenly faded.<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href=

        056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of

        Further, the edges of the calyx and petals of St. John's wort, as
        well as their external surface, are marked with dark purple spots and
        lines, which, if squeezed, yield a red essential oil soluble in
        spirits.<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href=

        According to others, St. John's blood is found at noon on St. John's
        Day, and only then, adhering in the form of beads to the root of a
        weed called knawel, which grows in sandy soil. But some people say
        that these beads of red juice are not really the blood of the
        martyred saint, but only insects resembling the cochineal or
        kermes-berry.<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href=

        custom of wearing girdles of mugwort on the Eve or Day of St. John
        has caused the plant to be popularly known in Germany and Bohemia as
        St. John's girdle. In Bohemia such girdles are believed to protect
        the wearer for the whole year against ghosts, magic, misfortune, and
        sickness. People also weave garlands of the plant and look through
        them at the midsummer bonfire or put them on their heads; and by
        doing so they ensure that their heads will not ache nor their eyes
        smart all that year. Another Bohemian practice is to make a decoction
        of mugwort which has been gathered on St. John's Day; then, when your
        cow is bewitched and will yield no milk, you have only to wash the
        animal thrice with the decoction and the spell will be broken.<a id=

        superstition in many parts of Europe has attributed to the fern at
        this season. At midnight on Midsummer Eve the plant is supposed to
        bloom and soon afterwards to seed; and whoever catches the bloom or
        the seed is thereby endowed with supernatural knowledge and
        miraculous powers; above all, he knows where treasures lie hidden in
        the ground, and he can render himself invisible at will by putting
        the seed in his shoe. But great precautions must be observed in
        procuring the wondrous bloom or seed, which else quickly vanishes
        like dew on sand or mist in the air. The seeker must neither touch it
        with his hand nor let it touch the ground; he spreads a white cloth
        under the plant, and the blossom or the seed falls into it. Beliefs
        of this sort concerning fern-seed have prevailed, with trifling
        variations of detail, in England, France, Germany, Austria, Italy,

        should, like the mistletoe, be a parasite growing from the hollow
        root of a fallen tree, whither the seed was carried by a bird or
        wafted by the wind. Armed with this fourfold implement of power the
        treasure-seeker proceeds at sundown to the spot where he expects to

        Mountains they say that many years ago there was a wondrous flower
        called springwort or Johnswort, which was as rare as it was
        marvellous. It bloomed only on St. John's Night (some say under a
        fern) between the hours of eleven and twelve; but when the last
        stroke of twelve was struck, the flower vanished away. Only in
        mountainous regions, where many noble metals reposed in the bosom of
        the earth, was the flower seen now and then in lonely meadows among
        the hills. The spirits of the hills wished by means of it to shew to
        men where their treasures were to be found. The flower itself was
        yellow and shone like a lamp in the darkness of night. It never stood
        still, but kept <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg
        070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        hopping constantly to and fro. It was also afraid of men and fled
        before them, and no man ever yet plucked it unless he had been set
        apart by Providence for the task. To him who was lucky enough to cull
        it the flower revealed all the treasures of the earth, and it made

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, the usual
        account given of the springwort is somewhat different. They say that
        the way to procure it is this. You mark a hollow in a tree where a
        green or black woodpecker has built its nest and hatched its young;
        you plug up the hole with a wooden wedge; then you hide behind the
        tree and wait. The woodpecker meantime has flown away but very soon
        returns with the springwort in its bill. It flutters up to the
        tree-trunk holding the springwort to the wedge, which at once, as if
        struck by a hammer, jumps out with a bang. Now is your chance. You
        rush from your concealment, you raise a loud cry, and in its fright
        the bird opens its bill and drops the springwort. Quick as thought
        you reach out a red or white cloth, with which you have taken care to
        provide yourself, and catch the magic flower as it falls. The
        treasure is now yours. Before its marvellous power all doors and
        locks fly open; it can make the bearer of it invisible; and neither
        steel nor lead can wound the man who carries it in the right-hand
        pocket of his coat. That is why people in Swabia say of a thief who
        cannot be caught, <span class="tei tei-q">“He must surely have a
        springwort.”</span><a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href=

        associates the springwort with the woodpecker is very ancient, for it
        is recorded by Pliny. It was a vulgar belief, he tells us, that if a
        shepherd plugged up a woodpecker's nest in the hollow of a tree with
        a wedge, the bird would bring a herb which caused the wedge to slip
        out of the hole; Trebius indeed affirmed that the wedge leaped out
        with a bang, however hard and fast you might have driven it into the
        tree.<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href=

        flower which possesses the same remarkable power of bursting open all
        doors and locks is chicory, provided always that you cut the flower
        with a piece of gold at noon or midnight on St. James's Day, the
        twenty-fifth of July. But in cutting it you must be perfectly silent;
        if you utter a sound, it is all up with you. There was a man who was
        just about to cut the flower of the chicory, when he looked up and
        saw a millstone hovering over his head. He fled for his life and
        fortunately escaped; but had he so much as opened his lips, the
        millstone would have dropped on him and crushed him as flat as a
        pancake. However, it is only a rare white variety of the chicory
        flower which can act as a picklock; the common bright blue flower is
        perfectly useless for the purpose.<a id="noteref_241" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many more examples
        might perhaps be cited of the marvellous virtues which certain plants
        have been supposed to acquire at the summer solstice, but the
        foregoing instances may suffice to prove that the superstition is
        widely spread, deeply rooted, and therefore probably very ancient in
        Europe. Why should plants be thought to be endowed with these
        wonderful properties on the longest day more than on any other day of
        the year? It seems difficult or impossible to explain such a belief
        except on the supposition that in some mystic way the plants catch
        from the sun, then at the full height of his power and glory, some
        fleeting effluence of radiant light and heat, which invests them for
        a time with powers above the ordinary for the healing of diseases and
        the unmasking and baffling of all the evil things that threaten the
        life of man. That the supposition is not purely hypothetical will
        appear from a folk-tale, to be noticed later on, in which the magic
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072"
        id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> bloom of the fern is directly
        derived from the sun at noon on Midsummer Day. And if the magic
        flowers of Midsummer Eve thus stand in direct relation to the sun,
        which many of them resemble in shape and colour, blooming in the
        meadows like little yellow suns fallen from the blue sky, does it not
        become probable that the bonfires kindled at the same time are the
        artificial, as the flowers are the natural, imitations of the great
        celestial fire then blazing in all its strength? At least analogy
        seems to favour the inference and so far to support Mannhardt's
        theory, that the bonfires kindled at the popular festivals of Europe,
        especially at the summer solstice, are intended to reinforce the
        waning or waxing fires of the sun. Thus if in our enquiry into these
        fire-festivals the scales of judgment are loaded with the adverse
        theories of Mannhardt and Westermarck, we may say that the weight,
        light as it is, of the magic flowers of Midsummer Eve seems to
        incline the trembling balance back to the side of Mannhardt.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor is it,

        granted that employment, which is undeniable, we have still to
        explain it, and that we can hardly do except by reference to the
        midsummer sun. And what is here said of the midsummer flowers applies
        equally to the midsummer bonfires. They too are used to destroy the
        charms of witches and warlocks; but if they can do so, may it not be
        in part because fires at midsummer are thought to burn with fiercer
        fury than at other times by sympathy with the fiercer fervour of the
        sun? This consideration would bring us back to an intermediate
        position between the opposing theories, namely, to the view that
        while the purely destructive aspect of fire is generally the most
        prominent and apparently the most important at these festivals, we
        must not overlook the additional force which by virtue of
        homoeopathic or imitative magic the bonfires may be supposed both to
        derive from and to impart to the sun, especially at the moment of the
        summer solstice when his strength is greatest and begins to decline,
        and when accordingly he can at once give and receive help to the
        greatest advantage.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To conclude this
        part of our subject it may not be amiss to illustrate by a few more
        miscellaneous examples the belief that Midsummer Eve is one of the
        great days of the year in which witches and warlocks pursue their
        nefarious calling; indeed in this respect Midsummer Eve perhaps
        stands second only to the famous Walpurgis Night (the Eve of May
        Day). For instance, in the neighbourhood of Lierre, in Belgium, the
        people think that on the night of Midsummer Eve all witches and
        warlocks must repair to a certain field which is indicated to them
        beforehand. There they hold their infernal Sabbath and are passed in
        review by a hellish magician, who bestows on them fresh powers. That
        is why old women are most careful, before going to bed on that night,
        to stop up doors and windows and every other opening in order to bar
        out the witches and warlocks, who but for this sage precaution might
        steal into the house and make the first trial of their new powers on
        the unfortunate inmates.<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href=
        "#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a> At
        Rottenburg, in Swabia, people thought that the devil and the witches
        could do much harm on Midsummer Eve; so they made fast their shutters
        and bunged up even the chinks and crannies, for wherever air can
        penetrate, there the devil and witches can worm their way in. All
        night long, too, from nine in the evening till break of day, the
        church bells rang to disturb the dreadful beings at their evil work,
        since there is perhaps no better means of putting the whole devilish
        crew to flight than the sound of church bells.<a id="noteref_244"

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a> Down to
        the second half of the nineteenth century the belief in witches was
        still widespread in Voigtland, a bleak mountainous region of Central
        Germany. It was especially on the Eve of May Day (Walpurgis), St.
        Thomas's Day, St. John's Day, and Christmas Eve, as well as on
        Mondays, that they were dreaded. Then they would come into a
        neighbour's house to beg, borrow, or steal something, no matter what;
        but woe to the poor wretch who suffered them to carry away so much as
        a chip or splinter of wood; for they would certainly use it to his
        undoing. On these witching nights the witches rode to their Sabbath
        on baking-forks and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg
        074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        dashers of churns; but if when they were hurtling through the
        darkness any one standing below addressed one of the witches by name,
        she would die within the year. To counteract and undo the spells
        which witches cast on man and beast, people resorted to all kinds of
        measures. Thus on the before-mentioned days folk made three crosses
        on the doors of the byres or guarded them by hanging up St. John's
        wort, marjoram, or other equally powerful talismans. Very often, too,
        the village youth would carry the war into the enemy's quarters by
        marching out in a body, cracking whips, firing guns, waving burning
        besoms, shouting and making an uproar, all for the purpose of
        frightening and driving away the witches.<a id="noteref_245" name=

        Prussia witches and warlocks used regularly to assemble twice a year
        on Walpurgis Night and the Eve of St. John. The places where they
        held their infernal Sabbath were various; for example, one was
        Pogdanzig, in the district of Schlochau. They generally rode on a
        baking-fork, but often on a black three-legged horse, and they took
        their departure up the chimney with the words, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Up and away and nowhere to stop!”</span> When they were
        all gathered on the Blocksberg or Mount of the Witches, they held
        high revelry, feasting first and then dancing on a tight rope
        lefthanded-wise to the inspiring strains which an old warlock drew
        from a drum and a pig's head.<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246"
        href="#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a> The
        South Slavs believe that on the night of Midsummer Eve a witch will
        slink up to the fence of the farmyard and say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The cheese to me, the lard to me, the butter to me, the
        milk to me, but the cowhide to thee!”</span> After that the cow will
        perish miserably and you will be obliged to bury the flesh and sell
        the hide. To prevent this disaster the thing to do is to go out into
        the meadows very early on Midsummer morning while the dew is on the
        grass, collect a quantity of dew in a waterproof mantle, carry it
        home, and having tethered your cow wash her down with the dew. After
        that you have only to place a milkpail under her udders and to milk
        away as hard as you can; the amount of milk that you will extract
        from that cow's dugs is quite surprising. Again, the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Slovenians about Görz and the Croats of
        Istria believe that on the same night the witches wage pitched
        battles with baptized folk, attacking them fiercely with broken
        stakes of palings and stumps of trees. It is therefore a wise
        precaution to grub up all the stumps in autumn and carry them home,
        so that the witches may be weaponless on St. John's Night. If the
        stumps are too heavy to be grubbed up, it is well to ram them down
        tighter into the earth, for then the witches will not be able to pull
        them up.<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From time
        immemorial the mistletoe has been the object of superstitious
        veneration in Europe. It was worshipped by the Druids, as we learn
        from a famous passage of Pliny. After enumerating the different kinds
        of mistletoe, he proceeds: <span class="tei tei-q">“In treating of
        this subject, the admiration in which the mistletoe is held
        throughout Gaul ought not to pass unnoticed. The Druids, for so they
        call their wizards, esteem nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and
        the tree on which it grows, provided only that the tree is an oak.
        But apart from this they choose oak-woods for their sacred groves and
        perform no sacred rites without oak-leaves; so that the very name of
        Druids may be regarded as a Greek appellation derived from their
        worship of the oak.<a id="noteref_248" name="noteref_248" href=

        id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they believe that whatever
        grows on these trees is sent from heaven, and is a sign that the tree
        has been chosen by the god himself. The mistletoe is very rarely to
        be met with; but when it is found, they gather it with solemn
        ceremony. This they do above all on the sixth day of the moon, from
        whence they date the beginnings of their months, of their years, and
        of their thirty years' cycle, because by the sixth day the moon has
        plenty of vigour and has not run half its course. After due
        preparations have been made for a sacrifice and a feast under the
        tree, they hail it as the universal healer and bring to the spot two
        white bulls, whose horns have never been bound before. A priest clad
        in a white robe climbs the tree and with a golden sickle cuts the
        mistletoe, which is caught in a white cloth. Then they sacrifice the
        victims, praying that God may make his own gift to prosper with those
        upon whom he has bestowed it. They believe that a potion prepared
        from mistletoe will make barren animals to bring forth, and that the
        plant is a remedy against all poison. So much of men's religion is
        commonly concerned with trifles.”</span><a id="noteref_249" name=

        possessed by mistletoe which grows on an oak; both of them deemed it
        an effectual remedy for a number of ailments, and both of them
        ascribed to it a quickening virtue, the Druids believing that a
        potion prepared from mistletoe would fertilize barren cattle, and the
        Italians holding that a piece of mistletoe carried about by a woman
        would help her to conceive a child. Further, both peoples thought
        that if the plant were to exert its medicinal properties it must be
        gathered in a certain way and at a certain time. It might not be cut
        with iron, hence the Druids cut it with gold; and it might not touch
        the earth, hence the Druids caught it in a white cloth. In choosing
        the time for gathering the plant, both peoples were determined by
        observation of the moon; only they differed as to the particular day

        mistletoe in peculiar veneration. They look upon it as a medicine,
        good in almost every disease, and it is sometimes taken in food and
        at others separately as a decoction. The leaves are used in
        preference to the berries, the latter being of too sticky a nature
        for general purposes.... But many, too, suppose this plant to have
        the power of making the gardens bear plentifully. When used for this
        purpose, the leaves are cut up into fine pieces, and, after having
        been prayed over, are sown with the millet and other seeds, a little
        also being eaten with the food. Barren women have also been known to
        eat the mistletoe, in order to be made to bear children. That

        the Druidical notion that the mistletoe was an <span class=

        The French writer who records this practice adds: <span class=

        this part of Africa what it was in the superstitions of the Gauls?
        This prejudice, common to the two countries, may have the same

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This suggestion as
        to the origin of the superstition is strongly confirmed by the
        Druidical belief, reported by Pliny, that whatever grew on an oak was
        sent from heaven and was a sign that the tree had been chosen by the

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> probably they thought that the celestial
        plant would have been profaned and its marvellous virtue lost by
        contact with the ground. With the ritual observed by the Druids in
        cutting the mistletoe we may compare the ritual which in Cambodia is
        prescribed in a similar case. They say that when you see an orchid
        growing as a parasite on a tamarind tree, you should dress in white,
        take a new earthenware pot, then climb the tree at noon, break off
        the plant, put it in the pot, and let the pot fall to the ground.
        After that you make in the pot a decoction which confers the gift of
        invulnerability.<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href=

        just as in Africa the leaves of one parasitic plant are supposed to
        render the wearer invulnerable, so in Cambodia a decoction made from
        another parasitic plant is considered to render the same service to
        such as make use of it, whether by drinking or washing. We may
        conjecture that in both places the notion of invulnerability is
        suggested by the position of the plant, which, occupying a place of
        comparative security above the ground, appears to promise to its
        fortunate possessor a similar security from some of the ills that
        beset the life of man on earth. We have already met with many
        examples of the store which the primitive mind sets on such vantage

        in the following manner. When the sun is in Sagittarius and the moon
        is on the wane, on the first, third, or fourth day before the new
        moon, one ought to shoot down with an arrow the mistletoe of an oak

        esteemed a panacea for all diseases, at least of children. In Sweden,

        from the parasitic nature of the plant, its position high up on the

        plants and animals are subject on the surface of the ground. From
        this point of view we can perhaps understand why mistletoe has so
        long and so persistently been prescribed as a cure for the falling
        sickness. As mistletoe cannot fall to the ground because it is rooted
        on the branch of a tree high above the earth, it seems to follow as a
        necessary consequence that an epileptic patient cannot possibly fall
        down in a fit so long as he carries a piece of mistletoe in his
        pocket or a decoction of mistletoe in his stomach. Such a train of

        in Wales it was believed that a sprig of mistletoe gathered on St.
        John's Eve (Midsummer Eve), or at any time before the berries
        appeared, would induce dreams of omen, both good <span class=

        mistletoe is one of the many plants whose magical or medicinal
        virtues are believed to culminate with the culmination of the sun on
        the longest day of the year. Hence it seems reasonable to conjecture
        that in the eyes of the Druids, also, who revered the plant so
        highly, the sacred mistletoe may have acquired a double portion of
        its mystic qualities at the solstice in June, and that accordingly
        they may have regularly cut it with solemn ceremony on Midsummer
        Eve.</p>

        one of the two main incidents of Balder's myth is reproduced in the
        great midsummer festival of Scandinavia. But the other main incident
        of the myth, the burning of Balder's body on a pyre, has also its
        counterpart in the bonfires which still blaze, or blazed till lately,

        their connexion with Balder beyond the reach of doubt, and makes it
        probable that in former times either a living representative or an
        effigy of Balder was annually burned in them. Midsummer was the
        season sacred to Balder, and the Swedish poet Tegner, in placing the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it has been
        shewn that the leading incidents of the Balder myth have their
        counterparts in those fire-festivals of our European peasantry which
        undoubtedly date from a time long prior to the introduction of
        Christianity. The pretence of throwing the victim chosen by lot into
        the Beltane fire,<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href=
        "#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a> may
        naturally be interpreted as traces of an older custom of actually
        burning human beings on these occasions; and the green dress of the
        Green Wolf, coupled with the leafy envelope of the young fellow who
        trod out the midsummer fire at Moosheim,<a id="noteref_299" name=
        "noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a> seems
        to hint that the persons who perished at these festivals did so in
        the character of tree-spirits or deities of vegetation. From all this
        we may reasonably infer that in the Balder myth on the one hand, and
        the fire-festivals and custom of gathering mistletoe on the other
        hand, we have, as it were, the two broken and dissevered halves of an
        original whole. In other words, we may assume with some degree of
        probability that the myth of Balder's death was not merely a myth,
        that is, a description of physical phenomena in imagery borrowed from
        human life, but that it was at the same time the story which people
        told to explain why they annually burned a human representative of
        the god and cut the mistletoe with solemn ceremony. If I am right,
        the story of Balder's tragic end formed, so to say, the text of the
        sacred drama which was acted year by year as a magical rite to cause
        the sun to shine, trees to grow, crops to thrive, and to guard man
        and beast from the baleful arts of fairies and trolls, of witches and
        warlocks. The tale belonged, in short, to that class of nature myths
        which are meant to be supplemented by ritual; here, as so often, myth
        stood to magic in the relation of theory to practice.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if the
        victims—the human Balders—who died by fire, whether in spring or at
        midsummer, were put to death as living embodiments of tree-spirits or
        deities of vegetation, it would seem that Balder himself must have

        089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or
        deity of vegetation. It becomes desirable, therefore, to determine,
        if we can, the particular kind of tree or trees, of which a personal
        representative was burned at the fire-festivals. For we may be quite
        sure that it was not as a representative of vegetation in general
        that the victim suffered death. The idea of vegetation in general is
        too abstract to be primitive. Most probably the victim at first
        represented a particular kind of sacred tree. Now of all European
        trees none has such claims as the oak to be considered as
        pre-eminently the sacred tree of the Aryans. Its worship is attested
        for all the great branches of the Aryan stock in Europe. We have seen
        that it was not only the sacred tree, but the principal object of

        According to Grimm, the oak ranked first among the holy trees of the

        Dodona, perhaps the oldest of all Greek sanctuaries, Zeus was

        then, the great god of both Greeks and Romans was represented in some
        of his oldest shrines under the form of an oak, and if the oak was
        the principal object of worship of Celts, Germans, and Lithuanians,
        we may certainly conclude that this tree was venerated by the Aryans
        in common before the dispersion; and that their primitive home must
        have lain in a land which was clothed with forests of oak.<a id=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, considering
        the primitive character and remarkable similarity of the
        fire-festivals observed by all the branches of the Aryan race in
        Europe, we may infer that these festivals form part of the common
        stock of religious observances which the various peoples carried with
        them in their wanderings from their old home. But, if I am right, an
        essential feature of those primitive fire-festivals was the burning
        of a man who represented the tree-spirit. In view, then, of the place
        occupied by the oak in the religion of the Aryans, the presumption is
        that the tree so represented at the fire-festivals must originally
        have been the oak. So far as the Celts and Lithuanians are concerned,
        this conclusion will perhaps hardly be contested. But both for them
        and for the Germans it is confirmed by a remarkable piece of
        religious conservatism. The most primitive method known to man of
        producing fire is by rubbing two pieces of wood against each other
        till they ignite; and we have seen that this method is still used in
        Europe for kindling sacred fires such as the need-fire, and that most
        probably it was formerly resorted to at all the fire-festivals under
        discussion. Now it is sometimes required that the need-fire, or other
        sacred fire, should be made by the friction of a particular kind of
        wood; and when the kind of wood is prescribed, whether among Celts,
        Germans, or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg

        to go out, it was rekindled by the friction of a piece of oak-wood,
        which had been previously heated by being struck with a grey (not a
        red) stone.<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href=

        the sacred fire was regularly kindled by the friction of oak-wood, we
        may infer that originally the fire was also fed with the same
        material. In point of fact, it appears that the perpetual fire of
        Vesta at Rome was fed with oak-wood,<a id="noteref_313" name=
        "noteref_313" href="#note_313"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a> and
        that oak-wood was the fuel consumed in the perpetual fire which
        burned under the sacred oak at the great Lithuanian sanctuary of
        Romove.<a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href=
        "#note_314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Further, that oak-wood was formerly the fuel burned in the midsummer
        fires may perhaps be inferred from the custom, said to be still
        observed by peasants in many mountain districts of Germany, of making
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092"
        id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> up the cottage fire on
        Midsummer Day with a heavy block of oak-wood. The block is so
        arranged that it smoulders slowly and is not finally reduced to
        charcoal till the expiry of a year. Then upon next Midsummer Day the
        charred embers of the old log are removed to make room for the new
        one, and are mixed with the seed-corn or scattered about the garden.
        This is believed to guard the food cooked on the hearth from
        witchcraft, to preserve the luck of the house, to promote the growth
        of the crops, and to preserve them from blight and vermin.<a id=

        the custom is almost exactly parallel to that of the Yule-log, which
        in parts of Germany, France, England, Servia, and other Slavonic
        lands was commonly of oak-wood.<a id="noteref_316" name="noteref_316"

            the mistletoe, and that the tree could not perish either by fire
            or water so long as the mistletoe remained intact among its
            boughs.</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if at these
        solemn rites the fire was regularly made of oak-wood, it follows that
        any man who was burned in it as a personification of the tree-spirit
        could have represented no tree but the oak. The sacred oak was thus
        burned in duplicate; the wood of the tree was consumed in the fire,
        and along with it was consumed a living man as a personification
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093"
        id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the oak-spirit. The
        conclusion thus drawn for the European Aryans in general is confirmed
        in its special application to the Scandinavians by the relation in
        which amongst them the mistletoe appears to have stood to the burning
        of the victim in the midsummer fire. We have seen that among
        Scandinavians it has been customary to gather the mistletoe at
        midsummer. But so far as appears on the face of this custom, there is
        nothing to connect it with the midsummer fires in which human victims
        or effigies of them were burned. Even if the fire, as seems probable,
        was originally always made with oak-wood, why should it have been
        necessary to pull the mistletoe? The last link between the midsummer
        customs of gathering the mistletoe and lighting the bonfires is
        supplied by Balder's myth, which can hardly be disjoined from the
        customs in question. The myth suggests that a vital connexion may
        once have been believed to subsist between the mistletoe and the
        human representative of the oak who was burned in the fire. According
        to the myth, Balder could be killed by nothing in heaven or earth
        except the mistletoe; and so long as the mistletoe remained on the
        oak, he was not only immortal but invulnerable. Now, if we suppose
        that Balder was the oak, the origin of the myth becomes intelligible.
        The mistletoe was viewed as the seat of life of the oak, and so long
        as it was uninjured nothing could kill or even wound the oak. The
        conception of the mistletoe as the seat of life of the oak would
        naturally be suggested to primitive people by the observation that
        while the oak is deciduous, the mistletoe which grows on it is
        evergreen. In winter the sight of its fresh foliage among the bare
        branches must have been hailed by the worshippers of the tree as a
        sign that the divine life which had ceased to animate the branches
        yet survived in the mistletoe, as the heart of a sleeper still beats
        when his body is motionless. Hence when the god had to be killed—when
        the sacred tree had to be burnt—it was necessary to begin by breaking
        off the mistletoe. For so long as the mistletoe remained intact, the
        oak (so people might think) was invulnerable; all the blows of their
        knives and axes would glance harmless from its surface. But once tear
        from the oak its sacred heart—the mistletoe—and the tree nodded
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094"
        id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to its fall. And when in later
        times the spirit of the oak came to be represented by a living man,
        it was logically necessary to suppose that, like the tree he
        personated, he could neither be killed nor wounded so long as the
        mistletoe remained uninjured. The pulling of the mistletoe was thus
        at once the signal and the cause of his death.</p>

        the parasite is thus deemed indestructible, it might easily be
        supposed to communicate its own indestructibility to the tree on
        which it grows, so long as the two remain in conjunction. Or to put
        the same idea in mythical form we might tell how the kindly god of
        the oak had his life securely deposited in the imperishable mistletoe
        which grew among the branches; how accordingly so long as the
        mistletoe kept its place there, the deity himself remained
        invulnerable; and how at last a cunning foe, let into the secret of
        the god's invulnerability, tore the mistletoe from the oak, thereby
        killing the oak-god and afterwards burning his body in a fire which
        could have made no impression on him so long as the incombustible
        parasite retained its seat among the boughs.</p>

        "#note_320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        temporary absences of the soul are often believed to involve
        considerable risk, since the wandering soul is liable to a variety of
        mishaps at the hands of enemies, and so forth. But there is another
        aspect to this power of disengaging the soul from the body. If only
        the safety of the soul can be ensured during its absence, there is no
        reason why the soul should not continue absent for an indefinite
        time; indeed a man may, on a pure calculation of personal safety,
        desire that his soul should never return to his body. Unable to
        conceive of life abstractly as a <span class="tei tei-q">“permanent
        possibility of sensation”</span> or a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“continuous adjustment of internal arrangements to
        external relations,”</span> the savage thinks of it as a concrete
        material thing of a definite bulk, capable of being seen and handled,
        kept in a box or jar, and liable to be bruised, fractured, or smashed
        in pieces. It is not needful that the life, so conceived, should be
        in the man; it may be absent from his body and still continue to
        animate him by virtue of a sort of sympathy or action at a distance.
        So long as this object which he calls his life or soul remains
        unharmed, the man is well; if it is injured, he suffers; if it is
        destroyed, he dies. Or, to put it otherwise, when a man is ill or
        dies, the fact is explained by saying that the material object called
        his life or soul, whether it be in his body or out of it, has either
        sustained injury or been destroyed. But there may <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> be circumstances in which, if the life or
        soul remains in the man, it stands a greater chance of sustaining
        injury than if it were stowed away in some safe and secret place.
        Accordingly, in such circumstances, primitive man takes his soul out
        of his body and deposits it for security in some snug spot, intending
        to replace it in his body when the danger is past. Or if he should
        discover some place of absolute security, he may be content to leave
        his soul there permanently. The advantage of this is that, so long as
        the soul remains unharmed in the place where he has deposited it, the
        man himself is immortal; nothing can kill his body, since his life is
        not in it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Evidence of this

        kind are widely diffused over the world, and from their number and
        the variety of incident and of details in which the leading idea is
        embodied, we may infer that the conception of an external soul is one
        which has had a powerful hold on the minds of men at an early stage
        of history. For folk-tales are a faithful reflection of the world as
        it appeared to the primitive mind; and we may be sure that any idea
        which commonly occurs in them, however absurd it may seem to us, must
        once have been an ordinary article of belief. This assurance, so far
        as it concerns the supposed power of disengaging the soul from the
        body for a longer or shorter time, is amply corroborated by a
        comparison of the folk-tales in question with the actual beliefs and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
        place, the story of the external soul is told, in various forms, by
        all Aryan peoples from Hindoostan to the Hebrides. A very common form
        of it is this: A warlock, giant, or other fairyland being is
        invulnerable and immortal because he keeps his soul hidden far away
        in some secret place; but a fair princess, whom he holds enthralled
        in his enchanted castle, wiles his secret from him and reveals it to
        the hero, who seeks out the warlock's soul, heart, life, or death (as
        it is variously called), and, by destroying it, simultaneously kills
        the warlock. Thus a Hindoo story tells how a magician called Punchkin
        held a queen captive for twelve years, and would fain marry her, but
        she would not have him. At last the queen's son came to rescue her,
        and the two plotted together to kill Punchkin. So the queen spoke the
        magician fair, and pretended that she had at last made up her mind to
        marry him. <span class="tei tei-q">“And do tell me,”</span> she said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“are you quite immortal? Can death never
        touch you? And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel human
        suffering?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“It is true,”</span> he
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“that I am not as others. Far, far
        away, hundreds of thousands <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg
        098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        miles from this, there lies a desolate country covered with thick
        jungle. In the midst of the jungle grows a circle of palm trees, and
        in the centre of the circle stand six chattees full of water, piled
        one above another: below the sixth chattee is a small cage, which
        contains a little green parrot;—on the life of the parrot depends my
        life;—and if the parrot is killed I must die. It is, however,”</span>
        he added, <span class="tei tei-q">“impossible that the parrot should
        sustain any injury, both on account of the inaccessibility of the
        country, and because, by my appointment, many thousand genii surround
        the palm trees, and kill all who approach the place.”</span> But the
        queen's young son overcame all difficulties, and got possession of
        the parrot. He brought it to the door of the magician's palace, and
        began playing with it. Punchkin, the magician, saw him, and, coming
        out, tried to persuade the boy to give him the parrot. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Give me my parrot!”</span> cried Punchkin. Then the boy
        took hold of the parrot and tore off one of his wings; and as he did
        so the magician's right arm fell off. Punchkin then stretched out his
        left arm, crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me my parrot!”</span>
        The prince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the magician's
        left arm tumbled off. <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me my
        parrot!”</span> cried he, and fell on his knees. The prince pulled
        off the parrot's right leg, the magician's right leg fell off; the
        prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell the magician's
        left. Nothing remained of him except the trunk and the head; but
        still he rolled his eyes, and cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me
        my parrot!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Take your parrot,
        then,”</span> cried the boy; and with that he wrung the bird's neck,
        and threw it at the magician; and, as he did so, Punchkin's head
        twisted round, and, with a fearful groan, he died!<a id="noteref_322"

        should die. <span class="tei tei-q">“Know, foolish girl,”</span> said
        the ogress, <span class="tei tei-q">“that we ogres never die. We are

        two bees from the pillar in one breath, and destroy them so that not

        certainly die; but if a single drop of blood falls to the ground,
        then from it will start up a thousand ogres. But what human being
        will find out this secret, or, finding it, will be able to achieve
        the feat? You need not, therefore, darling, be sad; I am practically
        immortal.”</span> As usual, the princess reveals the secret to the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another Italian
        tale sets forth how a great cloud, which was really a fairy, used to
        receive a young girl as tribute every year from a certain city; and
        the inhabitants had to give the girls up, for if they did not, the
        cloud would throw things at them and kill them all. One year it fell
        to the lot of the king's daughter to be handed over to the cloud, and
        they took her in procession, to the roll of muffled drums, and
        attended by her weeping father and mother, to the top of a mountain,
        and left her sitting in a chair there all alone. Then the fairy cloud
        came down on the top of the mountain, set the princess in her lap,
        and began to suck her blood out of her little finger; for it was on
        the blood of girls that this wicked fairy lived. When the poor
        princess was faint with the loss of blood and lay like a log, the
        cloud carried her away up to her fairy palace in the sky. But a brave
        youth had seen all that happened from behind a bush, and no sooner
        did the fairy spirit away the princess to her palace than he turned
        himself into an eagle and flew after them. He lighted on a tree just
        outside the palace, and looking in at the window he beheld a room
        full of young girls all in bed; for these were the victims of former
        years whom the fairy cloud had half killed by sucking their blood;
        yet they called her mamma. When the fairy went away and left the
        girls, the brave young man had food drawn up for them by ropes, and
        he told them to ask the fairy how she might be killed and what was to
        become of them when she died. It was a delicate question, but the
        fairy answered it, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> shall never die.”</span> However, when
        the girls pressed her, she took them out on a terrace and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you see that mountain far off there? On
        that mountain is a tigress with seven heads. If you wish me to die, a
        lion must fight that tigress and tear off all seven of her heads. In
        her body is an egg, and if any one hits me with it in the middle of
        my forehead, I shall die; but if that egg falls into my hands, the
        tigress will come to life again, resume her seven heads, and I shall
        live.”</span> When the young girls heard this they pretended to be
        glad and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Good! certainly our mamma can
        never die,”</span> but naturally they were discouraged. However, when
        she went away again, they told it all to the young man, and he bade
        them have no fear. Away he went to the mountain, turned himself into
        a lion, and fought the tigress. Meantime the fairy came home, saying,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Alas! I feel ill!”</span> For six days the
        fight went on, the young man tearing off one of the tigress's heads
        each day, and each day the strength of the fairy kept ebbing away.
        Then after allowing himself two days' rest the hero tore off the
        seventh head and secured the egg, but not till it had rolled into the
        sea and been brought back to him by a friendly dog-fish. When he
        returned to the fairy with the egg in his hand, she begged and prayed
        him to give it her, but he made her first restore the young girls to
        health and send them away in handsome carriages. When she had done
        so, he struck her on the forehead with the egg, and she fell down
        dead.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href=

        Similarly in a story from the western Riviera a sorcerer called
        Body-without-Soul can only be killed by means of an egg which is in
        an eagle, which is in a dog, which is in a lion; and the egg must be
        broken on the sorcerer's forehead. The hero, who achieves the
        adventure, has received the power of changing himself into a lion, a
        dog, an eagle, and an ant from four creatures of these sorts among
        whom he had fairly divided the carcase of a dead ass.<a id=

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stories of the
        same sort are current among Slavonic peoples. In some of them, as in
        the biblical story of Samson and Delilah, the warlock is questioned
        by a treacherous woman as to the place where his strength resides or
        his life or death is stowed away; and his suspicions being roused by
        her curiosity, he at first puts her off with false answers, but is at
        last beguiled into telling her the truth, thereby incurring his doom
        through her treachery. Thus a Russian story tells how a certain
        warlock called Kashtshei or Koshchei the Deathless carried off a
        princess and kept her prisoner in his golden castle. However, a
        prince made up to her one day as she was walking alone and
        disconsolate in the castle garden, and cheered by the prospect of
        escaping with him she went to the warlock and coaxed him with false
        and flattering words, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“My dearest
        friend, tell me, I pray you, will you never die?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Certainly not,”</span> says he. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> says she, <span class="tei tei-q">“and
        where is your death? is it in your dwelling?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“To be sure it is,”</span> says he, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it is in the broom under the threshold.”</span>
        Thereupon the princess seized the broom and threw it on the fire, but
        although the broom burned, the deathless Koshchei remained alive;
        indeed not so much as a hair of him was singed. Balked in her first
        attempt, the artful hussy pouted and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You do not love me true, for you have not told me where
        your death is; yet I am not angry, but love you with all my
        heart.”</span> With these fawning words she besought the warlock to
        tell her truly where his death was. So he laughed and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why do you wish to know? Well then, out of
        love I will tell you where it lies. In a certain field there stand
        three green oaks, and under the roots of the largest oak is a worm,
        and if ever this worm is found and crushed, that instant I shall
        die.”</span> When the princess heard these words, she went straight
        to her lover and told him all; and he searched till he found the oaks
        and dug up the worm and crushed it. Then he hurried to the warlock's
        castle, but only to learn from the princess that the warlock
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109"
        id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was still alive. Then she fell
        to wheedling and coaxing Koshchei once more, and this time, overcome
        by her wiles, he opened his heart to her and told her the truth.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“My death,”</span> said he, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“is far from here and hard to find, on the wide ocean. In
        that sea is an island, and on the island there grows a green oak, and
        beneath the oak is an iron chest, and in the chest is a small basket,
        and in the basket is a hare, and in the hare is a duck, and in the
        duck is an egg; and he who finds the egg and breaks it, kills me at
        the same time.”</span> The prince naturally procured the fateful egg
        and with it in his hands he confronted the deathless warlock. The
        monster would have killed him, but the prince began to squeeze the
        egg. At that the warlock shrieked with pain, and turning to the false
        princess, who stood by smirking and smiling, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Was it not out of love for you,”</span> said he,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that I told you where my death was? And is
        this the return you make to me?”</span> With that he grabbed at his
        sword, which hung from a peg on the wall; but before he could reach
        it, the prince had crushed the egg, and sure enough the deathless
        warlock found his death at the same moment.<a id="noteref_351" name=

        her sharply, <span class="tei tei-q">“What's that?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh,”</span> says she, <span class=

        So next day when the warlock was out, the prince came and gilded the
        whole fence; and in the evening when the warlock was at supper he
        looked out of the window and saw the fence glittering like gold.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And pray what may that be?”</span> said he
        to the princess. <span class="tei tei-q">“You see,”</span> said she,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“how I respect you. If you are dear to me,
        dear too is your death. That is why I have gilded the fence in which
        your death resides.”</span> The speech pleased the warlock, and in
        the fulness of his heart he revealed to her the fatal secret of the
        egg. When the prince, with the help of some friendly animals,
        obtained possession of the egg, he put it in his bosom and repaired
        to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name=

        The warlock himself was sitting at the window in a very gloomy frame
        of mind; and when the prince appeared and shewed him the egg, the
        light grew dim in the warlock's eyes and he became all of a sudden
        very meek and mild. But when the prince began to play with the egg
        and to throw it from one hand to the other, the deathless Koshchei
        staggered from one corner of the room to the other, and when the
        prince broke the egg, Koshchei the Deathless fell down and

        contrived to get speech of her and told her that she must persuade
        True Steel to reveal to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg
        111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> her
        where his strength lay. So when True Steel came home, the prince's

        <span class="tei tei-q">“O foolish woman! my strength is not in my
        sword, but in my bow and arrows.”</span> Then she turned towards the
        bow and arrows and prayed. But True Steel said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I see, my wife, you have a clever teacher who has taught
        you to find out where my strength lies. I could almost say that your
        husband is living, and it is he who teaches you.”</span> But she
        assured him that nobody had taught her. When she found he had
        deceived her again, she waited for some days and then asked him again
        about the secret of his strength. He answered, <span class=

        heart there is a bird, and in this bird is my strength. It is no easy
        task, however, to catch the fox, for she can transform herself into a
        multitude of creatures.”</span> So next day, when True Steel went
        forth from the cave, the prince came and learned from his wife the
        true secret of the warlock's strength. So away he hied to the
        mountain, and there, though the fox, or rather the vixen, turned
        herself into various shapes, he managed with the help of certain
        friendly eagles, falcons, and dragons, to catch and kill her. Then he
        took out the fox's heart, and out of the heart he took the bird and
        burned it in a great fire. At that very moment True Steel fell down

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another Servian
        story we read how a dragon resided in a water-mill and ate up two
        king's sons, one after the other. The third son went out to seek his
        brothers, and coming to the water-mill he found nobody in it but an
        old woman. She revealed to him the dreadful character of the being
        that kept the mill, and how he had devoured the prince's two elder
        brothers, and she implored him to go away home before the same fate
        should overtake him. But he was both <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> brave and cunning, and he said to her,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Listen well to what I am going to say to
        you. Ask the dragon whither he goes and where his strength is; then
        kiss all that place where he tells you his strength is, as if from
        love, till you find it out, and afterwards tell me when I
        come.”</span> So when the dragon came in, the old woman began to
        question him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Where in God's name have you
        been? Whither do you go so far? You will never tell me whither you
        go.”</span> The dragon replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, my
        dear old woman, I do go far.”</span> Then the old woman coaxed him,
        saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“And why do you go so far? Tell me
        where your strength is. If I knew where your strength is, I don't
        know what I should do for love; I would kiss all that place.”</span>
        Thereupon the dragon smiled and said to her, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yonder is my strength, in that fireplace.”</span> Then
        the old woman began to fondle and kiss the fireplace; and the dragon
        on seeing it burst into a laugh. <span class="tei tei-q">“Silly old
        woman,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“my strength is not
        there. It is in the tree-fungus in front of the house.”</span> Then
        the old woman began to fondle and kiss the tree; but the dragon
        laughed again and said to her, <span class="tei tei-q">“Away, old
        woman! my strength is not there.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then where is it?”</span> asked the old woman.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“My strength,”</span> said he, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“is a long way off, and you cannot go thither. Far in
        another kingdom under the king's city is a lake; in the lake is a
        dragon; in the dragon is a boar; in the boar is a pigeon, and in the
        pigeon is my strength.”</span> The murder was now out; so next
        morning when the dragon went away from the mill to attend to his
        usual business of eating people up, the prince came to the old woman
        and she let him into the secret of the dragon's strength. The prince
        accordingly set off to find the lake in the far country and the other
        dragon that lived in it. He found them both at last; the lake was a
        still and lonely water surrounded by green meadows, where flocks of
        sheep nibbled the sweet lush grass. The hero tucked up his hose and
        his sleeves, and wading out into the lake called aloud on the dragon
        to come forth and fight. Soon the monster emerged from the water,
        slimy and dripping, his scaly back glistening in the morning sun. The
        two grappled and wrestled from morning to afternoon of a long summer
        day. What with the heat of the weather and the violence of his
        exertions the dragon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg
        113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was
        quite exhausted, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let me go,
        prince, that I may moisten my parched head in the lake and toss you
        to the sky.”</span> But the prince sternly refused; so the dragon
        relaxed his grip and sank under the water, which bubbled and gurgled
        over the place where he plunged into the depths. When he had
        disappeared and the ripples had subsided on the surface, you would
        never have suspected that under that calm water, reflecting the green
        banks, the white, straying sheep, the blue sky, and the fleecy
        gold-flecked clouds of a summer evening, there lurked so ferocious
        and dangerous a monster. Next day the combat was renewed with the
        very same result. But on the third day the hero, fortified by a kiss
        from the fair daughter of the king of the land, tossed the dragon
        high in air, and when the monster fell with a most tremendous thud on
        the water he burst into little bits. Out of the pieces sprang a boar
        which ran away as fast as it could lay legs to the ground. But the
        prince sent sheep-dogs after it which caught it up and rent it in
        pieces. Out of the pieces sprang a pigeon; but the prince let loose a
        falcon, which stooped on the pigeon, seized it in its talons, and
        brought it to the prince. In the pigeon was the life of the dragon
        who kept the mill, so before inflicting on the monster the doom he so
        richly merited, the prince questioned him as to the fate of his two
        elder brothers who had perished at the hands, or rather under the
        claws and fangs, of the dragon. Having ascertained how to restore
        them to life and to release a multitude of other victims whom the
        dragon kept prisoners in a vault under the water-mill, the prince
        wrung the pigeon's neck, and that of course was the end of the dragon
        and his unscrupulous career.<a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Lithuanian story
        relates how a prince married a princess and got with her a kingdom to
        boot. She gave him the keys of the castle and told him he might enter
        every chamber except one small room, of which the key had a bit of
        twine tied to it. But one day, having nothing to do, he amused
        himself by rummaging in all the rooms of the castle, and amongst the
        rest he went into the little forbidden chamber. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> In it he found twelve heads and a man
        hanging on the hook of the door. The man said to the prince,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Oblige me by fetching me a glass of
        beer.”</span> The prince fetched it and the man drank it. Then the
        man said to the prince, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oblige me by
        releasing me from the hook.”</span> The prince released him. Now the
        man was a king without a soul, and he at once availed himself of his
        liberty to come to an understanding with the coachman of the castle,
        and between them they put the prince's wife in the coach and drove
        off with her. The prince rode after them and coming up with the coach
        called out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Halt, Soulless King! Step out
        and fight!”</span> The King stepped out and the fight began. In a
        trice the King had sliced the buttons off the prince's coat and
        pinked him in the side. Then he stepped into the coach and drove off.
        The prince rode after him again, and when he came up with the coach
        he called out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Halt, Soulless King! Step out
        and fight!”</span> The King stepped out and they fought again, and
        again the King sliced off the prince's buttons and pinked him in the
        side. Then, after carefully wiping and sheathing his sword, he said
        to his discomfited adversary, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now look here.
        I let you off the first time for the sake of the glass of beer you
        gave me, and I let you off the second time because you let me down
        from that infernal hook; but if you fight me a third time, by Gad
        I'll make mince meat of you.”</span> Then he stepped into the coach,
        told the coachman to drive on, jerked up the coach window with a
        bang, and drove away like anything. But the prince galloped after him
        and coming up with the coach for the third time he called out,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Halt, Soulless King! Step out and
        fight!”</span> The King did step out, and at it the two of them went,
        tooth and nail. But the prince had no chance. Before he knew where he
        was, the King ran him through the body, whisked off his head, and
        left him lying a heap of raw mince beside the road. His wife, or
        rather his widow, said to the King, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let me
        gather up the fragments that remain.”</span> The King said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly.”</span> So she made up the mince
        into a neat parcel, deposited it on the front seat of the coach, and
        away they drove to the King's castle. Well to cut a long story short,
        a brother-in-law of the deceased prince sent a hawk to fetch the
        water of life; the hawk brought it in his beak; <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the brother-in-law poured the water on
        the fragments of the prince, and the prince came to life again at
        once safe and sound. Then he went to the King's castle and played on
        a little pipe, and his wife heard it in the castle and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“That is how my husband used to play, whom
        the King cut in bits.”</span> So she went out to the gate and said to
        him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you my husband?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“That I am,”</span> said he, and he told her
        to find out from the King where he kept his soul and then to come and
        tell him. So she went to the King and said to him, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Where my husband's soul is, there must mine be
        too.”</span> The King was touched by this artless expression of her
        love, and he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“My soul is in yonder
        lake. In that lake lies a stone; in that stone is a hare; in the hare
        is a duck, in the duck is an egg, and in the egg is my soul.”</span>
        So the queen went and told her former husband, the prince, and gave
        him plenty of money and food for the journey, and off he set for the
        lake. But when he came to the lake, he did not know in which part of
        it the stone was; so he roamed about the banks, and he was hungry,
        for he had eaten up all the food. Then he met a dog, and the dog said
        to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't shoot me dead. I will be a
        mighty helper to you in your time of need.”</span> So he let the dog
        live and went on his way. Next he saw a tree with two hawks on it, an
        old one and a young one, and he climbed up the tree to catch the
        young one. But the old hawk said to him, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Don't take my young one. He will be a mighty helper to
        you in your time of need.”</span> So the prince climbed down the tree
        and went on his way. Then he saw a huge crab and wished to break off
        one of his claws for something to eat, but the crab said to him,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't break off my claw. It will be a mighty
        helper to you in your time of need.”</span> So he left the crab alone
        and went on his way. And he came to people and got them to fish up
        the stone for him from the lake and to bring it to him on the bank.
        And there he broke the stone in two and out of the stone jumped a
        hare. But the dog seized the hare and tore him, and out of the hare
        flew a duck. The young hawk pounced on the duck and rent it, and out
        of the duck fell an egg, and the egg rolled into the lake. But the
        crab fetched the egg out of the lake and brought it to the prince.
        Then the King fell ill. So the prince went to the King and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116"
        id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You killed me. Now I will kill you.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Don't,”</span> said the King. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        will,”</span> said the prince. With that he threw the egg on the
        ground, and the King fell out of the bed as dead as a stone. So the
        prince went home with his wife and very happy they were, you may take
        my word for it.<a id="noteref_359" name="noteref_359" href=

        last story, as in many other stories of the same type, the hero
        achieves his adventure by the help of certain grateful animals whom
        he had met and done a service to on his travels. The same incident
        occurs in another German tale of this class which runs thus. Once
        upon a time there was a young fellow called Body-without-Soul, or,
        for short, Soulless, and he was a cannibal who would eat nothing but
        young girls. Now it was a custom in that country that the girls drew
        lots every year, and the one on whom the lot fell was handed over to
        Soulless. In time it happened that the lot fell on the king's
        daughter. The king was exceedingly sorry, but what could he do? Law
        was law, and had to be obeyed. So they took the princess to the
        castle where Soulless resided; and he shut her up in the larder and
        fattened her for his dinner. But a brave soldier undertook to rescue
        her, and off he set for the cannibal's castle. Well, as he trudged
        along, what should he see but a fly, an eagle, a bear, and a lion
        sitting in a field by the side of the road, and quarrelling about
        their shares in a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg
        117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        dead horse. So he divided the carcase fairly between them, and as a
        reward the fly and the eagle bestowed on him the power of changing
        himself at will into either of their shapes. That evening he made
        himself into an eagle, and flew up a high tree; there he looked
        about, but could see nothing but trees. Next morning he flew on till
        he came to a great castle, and at the gate was a big black board with
        these words chalked up on it: <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Soulless
        lives here.”</span> When the soldier read that he was glad, and
        changed himself into a fly, and flew buzzing from window to window,
        looking in at every one till he came to the one where the fair
        princess sat a prisoner. He introduced himself at once and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I am come to free you, but first you must
        learn where the soul of Soulless really is.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't know,”</span> replied the princess, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but I will ask.”</span> So after much coaxing and
        entreaty she learned that the soul of Soulless was in a box, and that
        the box was on a rock in the middle of the Red Sea. When the soldier
        heard that, he turned himself into an eagle again, flew to the Red
        Sea, and came back with the soul of Soulless in the box. Arrived at
        the castle he knocked and banged at the door as if the house was on
        fire. Soulless did not know what was the matter, and he came down and
        opened the door himself. When he saw the soldier standing at it, I
        can assure you he was in a towering rage. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What do you mean,”</span> he roared, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“by knocking at my door like that? I'll gobble you up on
        the spot, skin and hair and all.”</span> But the soldier laughed in
        his face. <span class="tei tei-q">“You'd better not do that,”</span>
        said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“for here I've got your soul in the
        box.”</span> When the cannibal heard that, all his courage went down
        into the calves of his legs, and he begged and entreated the soldier
        to give him his soul. But the soldier would not hear of it; he opened
        the box, took out the soul, and flung it over his head; and that same
        instant down fell the cannibal, dead as a door-nail.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another German
        story, which embodies the notion of the external soul in a somewhat
        different form, tells how once upon a time a certain king had three
        sons and a daughter, and for each of the king's four children there
        grew a flower in the king's garden, which was a life-flower;
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118"
        id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for it bloomed and flourished
        so long as the child lived, but drooped and withered away when the
        child died. Now the time came when the king's daughter married a rich
        man and went to live with him far away. But it was not long before
        her flower withered in the king's garden. So the eldest brother went
        forth to visit his brother-in-law and comfort him in his bereavement.
        But when he came to his brother-in-law's castle he saw the corpse of
        his murdered sister weltering on the ramparts. And his wicked
        brother-in-law set before him boiled human hands and feet for his
        dinner. And when the king's son refused to eat of them, his
        brother-in-law led him through many chambers to a murder-hole, where
        were all sorts of implements of murder, but especially a gallows, a
        wheel, and a pot of blood. Here he said to the prince, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You must die, but you may choose your kind of
        death.”</span> The prince chose to die on the gallows; and die he did
        even as he had said. So the eldest son's flower withered in the
        king's garden, and the second son went forth to learn the fate of his
        brother and sister. But it fared with him no better than with his
        elder brother, for he too died on the gallows in the murder-hole of
        his wicked brother-in-law's castle, and his flower also withered away
        in the king's garden at home. Now when the youngest son was also come
        to his brother-in-law's castle and saw the corpse of his murdered
        sister weltering on the ramparts, and the bodies of his two murdered
        brothers dangling from the gallows in the murder-hole, he said that
        for his part he had a fancy to die by the wheel, but he was not quite
        sure how the thing was done, and would his brother-in-law kindly shew
        him? <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, it's quite easy,”</span> said his
        brother-in-law, <span class="tei tei-q">“you just put your head in,
        so,”</span> and with that he popped his head through the middle of
        the wheel. <span class="tei tei-q">“Just so,”</span> said the king's
        youngest son, and he gave the wheel a twirl, and as it spun round and
        round, the wicked brother-in-law died a painful death, which he
        richly deserved. And when he was quite dead, the murdered brothers
        and sister came to life again, and their withered flowers bloomed
        afresh in the king's garden.<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another German
        story an old warlock lives with a damsel all alone in the midst of a
        vast and gloomy wood. She fears that being old he may die and leave
        her alone in the forest. But he reassures her. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dear child,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        cannot die, and I have no heart in my breast.”</span> But she
        importuned him to tell her where his heart was. So he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Far, far from here in an unknown and
        lonesome land stands a great church. The church is well secured with
        iron doors, and round about it flows a broad deep moat. In the church
        flies a bird and in the bird is my heart. So long as the bird lives,
        I live. It cannot die of itself, and no one can catch it; therefore I
        cannot die, and you need have no anxiety.”</span> However the young
        man, whose bride the damsel was to have been before the warlock
        spirited her away, contrived to reach the church and catch the bird.
        He brought it to the damsel, who stowed him and it away under the
        warlock's bed. Soon the old warlock came home. He was ailing, and
        said so. The girl wept and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Alas, daddy
        is dying; he has a heart in his breast after all.”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Child,”</span> replied the warlock,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“hold your tongue. I <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can't</span></em>
        die. It will soon pass over.”</span> At that the young man under the
        bed gave the bird a gentle squeeze; and as he did so, the old warlock
        felt very unwell and sat down. Then the young man gripped the bird
        tighter, and the warlock fell senseless from his chair. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now squeeze him dead,”</span> cried the damsel. Her
        lover obeyed, and when the bird was dead, the old warlock also lay
        dead on the floor.<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href=

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another Danish
        story tells how a lad went out into the world to look for service. He
        met a man, who hired him for three years and said he would give him a
        bushel of money for the first year, two bushels of money for the
        second, and three bushels of money for the third. The lad was well
        content, as you may believe, to get such good wages. But the man was
        a magician, and it was not long before he turned the lad into a hare,
        by pronouncing over him some strange words. For a whole year the lad
        scoured the woods in the shape of a hare, and there was not a
        sportsman in all the country round about that had not a shot at him.
        But not one of them could hit him. At the end of the year the
        magician spoke some other words over him and turned him back into
        human form and gave him the bushel of money. But then the magician
        mumbled some other words, and the lad was turned into a raven and
        flew up into the sky. Again all the marksmen of the neighbourhood
        pointed their guns at him and banged away; but they only wasted
        powder and shot, for not one of them could hit him. At the end of the
        year the magician changed him back into a man and gave him two
        bushelfuls of money. But soon after he changed him into a fish, and
        in the form of a fish the young man jumped into the brook and swam
        down into the sea. There at the bottom of the ocean he saw a most
        beautiful castle all of glass and in it a lovely girl all alone.
        Round and round the castle he swam, looking into all the rooms and
        admiring everything. At last he remembered the words the magician had
        spoken when he turned him back into a man, and by repeating them he
        was at once transformed into a stripling again. He walked into the
        glass castle and introduced himself to the girl, and though at first
        she was nearly frightened to death, she was soon very glad to have
        him with her. From her he learned that she was no other than the
        daughter of the magician, who kept her there for safety at the bottom
        of the sea. The two now laid their heads together, and she told him
        what to do. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg
        122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        There was a certain king who owed her father money and had not the
        wherewithal to pay; and if he did not pay by such and such a day, his
        head was to be cut off. So the young man was to take service with the
        king, offer him the bushels of money which he had earned in the
        service of the magician, and go with him to the magician to pay his
        debt. But he was to dress up as the court Fool so that the magician
        would not know him, and in that character he was to indulge in
        horse-play, smashing windows and so on, till the magician would fall
        into such a rage that though the king had paid his debt to the last
        farthing he would nevertheless be condemned to instant execution
        unless he could answer the magician's questions. The questions would
        be these, <span class="tei tei-q">“Where is my daughter?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Would you know her if you saw her?”</span>
        Now the magician would cause a whole line of phantom women to pass
        by, so that the young man would not be able to tell which of them was
        the sorcerer's daughter; but when her turn came to pass by she would
        give him a nudge as a sign, and so he would know her. Then the
        magician would ask, <span class="tei tei-q">“And where is my
        heart?”</span> And the young man was to say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In a fish.”</span> And the magician would ask,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Would you know the fish if you saw
        it?”</span> And he would cause all sorts of fishes to pass by, and
        the young man would have to say in which of them was the heart of the
        magician. He would never be able of himself to tell in which of them
        it was, but the girl would stand beside him, and when the right fish
        passed by, she would nudge him and he was to catch it and rip it up,
        and the magician would ask him no more questions. Everything turned
        out exactly as she had said. The king paid his debt to the last
        farthing; but the young man disguised as the court Fool cut such
        capers and smashed so many glass windows and doors that the heaps of
        broken glass were something frightful to contemplate. So there was
        nothing for it but that the king, who was of course responsible for
        the pranks of his Fool, should either answer the magician's questions
        or die the death. While they were getting the axe and the block ready
        in the courtyard, the trembling king was interrogated by the stern
        magician. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where is my daughter?”</span>
        asked the sorcerer. Here the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> court Fool cut in and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She is at the bottom of the sea.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Would you know her if you saw her?”</span> enquired the
        magician. <span class="tei tei-q">“To be sure I would,”</span>
        answered the Fool. So the magician caused a whole regiment of girls
        to defile before him, one after the other; but they were mere
        phantoms and apparitions. Almost the last of all came the magician's
        daughter, and when she passed the young man she pinched his arm so
        hard that he almost shrieked with pain. However, he dissembled his
        agony and putting his arm round her waist held her fast. The magician
        now played his last trump. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where is my
        heart?”</span> said he. <span class="tei tei-q">“In a fish,”</span>
        said the Fool. <span class="tei tei-q">“Would you know the fish if
        you saw it?”</span> asked the magician. <span class="tei tei-q">“To
        be sure I would,”</span> answered the Fool. Then all the fishes of
        the sea swam past, and when the right one came last of all, the girl
        nudged her lover; he seized the fish, and with one stroke of his
        knife slit it from end to end. Out tumbled the magician's heart; the
        young man seized it and cut it in two, and at the same moment the
        magician fell dead.<a id="noteref_367" name="noteref_367" href=

        they could not find him. At the news the king was inconsolable, and
        taking to his bed caused proclamation to be made that he who could
        find and bring back his lost son should have half the kingdom. Now an
        old man and his old wife lived together in a wretched hut, and they
        had a daughter. She resolved to seek the lost prince and get the
        promised reward. So her parents gave her food for the journey and a
        pair of new shoes, and off she set. Well, she walked and better
        walked for days, and at last she came towards evening to a cave and
        going into it she saw two beds. One of them was covered with a cloth
        of silver and the other with a cloth of gold; and in the bed with the
        golden coverlet was the king's son fast asleep. She tried to wake
        him, but all in vain. Then she noticed some runes carved on the
        bedsteads, but she could not read them. So she went back to the mouth

        id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the cave and hid behind the
        door. Hardly had she time to conceal herself when she heard a loud
        noise and saw two giantesses, two great hulking louts they were,
        stride into the cave. No sooner were they in than one said to the
        other, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ugh, what a smell of human flesh in
        our cave!”</span> But the other thought the smell might come from the
        king's son. They went up to the bed where he was sleeping, and
        calling two swans, which the girl had not perceived in the dim light
        of the cave, they said:—</p>

        the bed with the silver coverlet and slept till break of day. When
        they woke in the morning, they wakened the prince and offered him
        food again, but he again refused it; and the younger hag again asked
        him if he would have her to wife, but he would not hear of it. So
        they put him to sleep again to the singing of the swans and left the
        cave. When they were gone a while, the girl came forth from her
        hiding-place and waked the king's son to the song of the swans, and
        he was glad to see her and to get the news. She told him that, when
        the hag asked him again to marry her, he must say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, but you must first tell me what is written on the
        beds, and what you do by day.”</span> So when it drew to evening, the
        girl hid herself again, and soon the giantesses came, lit a fire in
        the cave, and cooked at it the game they had brought with them. And
        the younger hag wakened the king's son and asked him if he would have
        something to eat. This time he said <span class=

        very glad to know it, but she must also tell him what they did all
        day long out there in the wood. The hag told him that they hunted
        beasts and birds, and that between whiles they sat down under an oak
        and threw their life-egg from one to the other, but they had to be
        careful, for if the egg were to break, they would both die. The
        king's son thanked her kindly, but next morning when the giantess
        asked him to go with them to the wood he said that he would rather
        stay at home. So away went the giantesses by themselves, after they
        had lulled him to sleep to the singing of the swans. But hardly were
        their backs turned when out came the girl and wakened the prince and
        told him to take his spear, and they would pursue the giantesses, and
        when they were throwing their life-egg to each other he was to hurl
        his spear at it and smash it to bits. <span class="tei tei-q">“But if
        you miss,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is as much as
        your life is worth.”</span> So they came to the oak in the wood, and
        there they heard a loud laugh, and the king's son climbed up the
        tree, and there under the oak were the two giantesses, and one of
        them had a golden egg in her hand and threw it to the other. Just
        then the king's son hurled his spear and hit the egg so that it
        burst. At the same time the two hags fell dead to the ground and the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conception of
        the external soul meets us also in Celtic stories. Thus a tale, told
        by a blind fiddler in the island of Islay, relates how a giant
        carried off a king's wife and his two horses and kept them in his
        den. But the horses attacked the giant and mauled him so that he
        could hardly crawl. He said to the queen, <span class="tei tei-q">“If
        I myself had my soul to keep, those horses would have killed me long
        ago.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And where, my dear,”</span>
        said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“is thy soul? By the books I will
        take care of it.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“It is in the
        Bonnach stone,”</span> said he. So on the morrow when the giant went
        out, the queen set the Bonnach stone in order exceedingly. In the
        dusk of the evening the giant came back, and he said to the queen,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What made thee set the Bonnach stone in
        order like that?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Because thy soul is
        in it,”</span> quoth she. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        perceive,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“that if thou
        didst know where my soul is, thou wouldst give it much
        respect.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“That I would,”</span> said
        she. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not there,”</span> said he,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“my soul is; it is in the threshold.”</span>
        On the morrow she set the threshold in order finely, and when the
        giant returned, he asked her, <span class="tei tei-q">“What brought
        thee to set the threshold in order like that?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Because thy soul is in it,”</span> said she.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I perceive,”</span> said he, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that if thou knewest where my soul is, thou wouldst take
        care of it.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“That I would,”</span>
        said she. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not there that my soul
        is,”</span> said he. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is a great
        flagstone under the threshold. There is a wether under the flag.
        There is a duck in the wether's belly, and an egg in the belly of the
        duck, and it is in the egg that my soul is.”</span> On the morrow
        when the giant was gone, they raised the flagstone and out came the
        wether. They opened the wether and out came the duck. They split the
        duck, and out came the egg. And the queen took the egg and crushed it
        in her hands, and at that very moment the giant, who was coming home
        in the dusk, fell down dead.<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370"

        story relates how a big giant, King of Sorcha, stole away the wife
        and the shaggy dun filly of the herdsman or king of Cruachan. So the
        herdsman baked a bannock to take with him by the way, and set off in
        quest of his wife and the filly. He went for a long, long time, till
        at last his soles were blackened and his cheeks were sunken, the
        yellow-headed birds were going to rest at the roots of the bushes and
        the tops of the thickets, and the dark clouds of night were coming
        and the clouds of day were departing; and he saw a house far from
        him, but though it was far from him he did not take long to reach it.
        He went in, and sat in the upper end of the house, but there was no
        one within; and the fire was newly kindled, the house newly swept,
        and the bed newly made; and who came in but the hawk of Glencuaich,
        and she said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you here, young son
        of Cruachan?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I am,”</span> said he.
        The hawk said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you know who was
        here last night?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not,”</span>
        said he. <span class="tei tei-q">“There were here,”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128"
        id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> said she, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the big giant, King of Sorcha, your wife, and the shaggy
        dun filly; and the giant was threatening terribly that if he could
        get hold of you he would take the head off you.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I well believe it,”</span> said he. Then she gave him
        food and drink, and sent him to bed. She rose in the morning, made
        breakfast for him, and baked a bannock for him to take with him on
        his journey. And he went away and travelled all day, and in the
        evening he came to another house and went in, and was entertained by
        the green-headed duck, who told him that the giant had rested there
        the night before with the wife and shaggy dun filly of the herdsman
        of Cruachan. And next day the herdsman journeyed again, and at
        evening he came to another house and went in and was entertained by
        the fox of the scrubwood, who told him just what the hawk of
        Glencuaich and the green-headed duck had told him before. Next day
        the same thing happened, only it was the brown otter of the burn that
        entertained him at evening in a house where the fire was newly
        kindled, the floor newly swept, and the bed newly made. And next
        morning when he awoke, the first thing he saw was the hawk of
        Glencuaich, the green-headed duck, the fox of the scrubwood, and the
        brown otter of the burn all dancing together on the floor. They made
        breakfast for him, and partook of it all together, and said to him,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Should you be at any time in straits, think
        of us, and we will help you.”</span> Well, that very evening he came
        to the cave where the giant lived, and who was there before him but
        his own wife? She gave him food and hid him under clothes at the
        upper end of the cave. And when the giant came home he sniffed about
        and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The smell of a stranger is in the
        cave.”</span> But she said no, it was only a little bird she had
        roasted. <span class="tei tei-q">“And I wish you would tell
        me,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“where you keep your
        life, that I might take good care of it.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is in a grey stone over there,”</span> said he. So
        next day when he went away, she took the grey stone and dressed it
        well, and placed it in the upper end of the cave. When the giant came
        home in the evening he said to her, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is
        it that you have dressed there?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Your
        own life,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“and we must be
        careful of it.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I perceive that you
        are very fond of me, but it is not <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-q">“Where is it?”</span> said she. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is in a grey sheep on yonder hillside,”</span> said
        he. On the morrow, when he went away, she got the grey sheep, dressed
        it well, and placed it in the upper end of the cave. When he came
        home in the evening he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is it that
        you have dressed there?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Your own
        life, my love,”</span> said she. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not
        there as yet,”</span> said he. <span class="tei tei-q">“Well!”</span>
        said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“you are putting me to great
        trouble taking care of it, and you have not told me the truth these
        two times.”</span> He then said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I think
        that I may tell it to you now. My life is below the feet of the big
        horse in the stable. There is a place down there in which there is a
        small lake. Over the lake are seven grey hides, and over the hides
        are seven sods from the heath, and under all these are seven oak
        planks. There is a trout in the lake, and a duck in the belly of the
        trout, an egg in the belly of the duck, and a thorn of blackthorn
        inside of the egg, and till that thorn is chewed small I cannot be
        killed. Whenever the seven grey hides, the seven sods from the heath,
        and the seven oak planks are touched I shall feel it wherever I shall
        be. I have an axe above the door, and unless all these are cut
        through with one blow of it the lake will not be reached; and when it
        will be reached I shall feel it.”</span> Next day, when the giant had
        gone out hunting on the hill, the herdsman of Cruachan contrived,
        with the help of the friendly animals—the hawk, the duck, the fox,
        and the otter—to get possession of the fateful thorn and to chew it
        before the giant could reach him; and no sooner had he done so than
        the giant dropped stark and stiff, a corpse.<a id="noteref_373" name=

        the other, at intervals of seven years. The bereaved monarch sent
        champions to rescue his lost daughters, but though they surprised the
        giant in his sleep and cut off his head, it was all to no purpose;
        for as fast as they cut it off he put it on again and made after them
        as if nothing had happened. So the champions fled away before him as
        fast as they could lay legs to the ground, and the more agile of them
        escaped, but the shorter-winded he <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        on hooks against the turrets of his castle. So he went by the name of
        the Bare-Stripping Hangman. Now this amiable man had announced his
        intention of coming to fetch away the fourth and last of the king's
        daughters, when another seven years should be up. The time was
        drawing near, and the king, with the natural instincts of a father,
        was in great tribulation, when as good luck would have it a son of
        the king of Ireland, by name Alastir, arrived in the king's castle
        and undertook to find out where the Bare-Stripping Hangman had hidden
        his soul. To cut a long story short, the artful Hangman had hidden
        his soul in an egg, which was in the belly of a duck, which was in
        the belly of a salmon, which was in the belly of a swift-footed hind
        of the cliffs. The prince wormed the secret from a little old man,
        and by the help of a dog, a brown otter, and a falcon he contrived to
        extract the egg from its various envelopes and crushed it to bits
        between his hands and knees. So when he came to the giant's castle he

        it came to pass that one night the giant and his wife had a great
        dispute, and Hugh overheard their talk, and learned that the giant's
        soul was in a precious gem which he always wore on his forehead. So
        the prince watched his opportunity, seized the gem, and having no
        means of escape or concealment, hastily swallowed it. Like lightning
        from the clouds, the giant's sword flashed from its scabbard and flew
        between Hugh's head and his body to intercept the gem before it could
        descend into the prince's stomach. But it was too late; and the giant
        fell down, sword in hand, and expired without a gasp. Hugh had now
        lost his head, it is true, but having the giant's soul in his body he
        felt none the worse for the accident. So he buckled the giant's sword
        at his side, mounted the grey filly, swifter than the east wind,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131"
        id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that never had a bridle, and
        rode home. But the want of his head made a painful impression on his
        friends; indeed they maintained that he was a ghost and shut the door
        in his face, so now he wanders for ever in shades of darkness, riding
        the grey filly fleeter than the wind. On stormy nights, when the wind
        howls about the gables and among the trees, you may see him galloping
        along the shore of the sea <span class="tei tei-q">“between wave and
        sand.”</span> Many a naughty little boy, who would not go quietly to
        bed, has been carried off by Headless Hugh on his grey filly and
        never seen again.<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Sutherlandshire
        at the present day there is a sept of Mackays known as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the descendants of the seal,”</span> who claim to be
        sprung from a mermaid, and the story they tell in explanation of
        their claim involves the notion of the external soul. They say that
        the laird of Borgie used to go down to the rocks under his castle to
        bathe. One day he saw a mermaid close in shore, combing her hair and
        swimming about, as if she were anxious to land. After watching her
        for a time, he noticed her cowl on the rocks beside him, and knowing
        that she could not go to sea without it, he carried the cowl up to
        the castle in the hope that she would follow him. She did so, but he
        refused to give up the cowl and detained the sea-maiden herself and
        made her his wife. To this she consented with great reluctance, and
        told him that her life was bound up with the cowl, and that if it
        rotted or was destroyed she would instantly die. So the cowl was
        placed for safety in the middle of a great hay-stack, and there it
        lay for years. One unhappy day, when the laird was from home, the
        servants were working among the hay and found the cowl. Not knowing
        what it was, they shewed it to the lady of the house. The sight
        revived memories of her old life in the depths of the sea, so she
        took the cowl, and leaving her child in its cot, plunged into the sea
        and never <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg

        came home to Borgie any more. Only sometimes she would swim close in
        shore to see her boy, and then she wept because he was not of her own
        kind that she might take him to sea with her. The boy grew to be a
        man, and his descendants are famous swimmers. They cannot drown, and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In an Irish story
        we read how a giant kept a beautiful damsel a prisoner in his castle
        on the top of a hill, which was white with the bones of the champions
        who had tried in vain to rescue the fair captive. At last the hero,
        after hewing and slashing at the giant all to no purpose, discovered
        that the only way to kill him was to rub a mole on the giant's right
        breast with a certain egg, which was in a duck, which was in a chest,
        which lay locked and bound at the bottom of the sea. With the help of
        some obliging salmon, rams, and eagles, the hero as usual made
        himself master of the precious egg and slew the giant by merely
        striking it against the mole on his right breast.<a id="noteref_377"

        Similarly in a Breton story there figures a giant whom neither fire
        nor water nor steel can harm. He tells his seventh wife, whom he has
        just married after murdering all her predecessors, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am immortal, and no one can hurt me unless he crushes
        on my breast an egg, which is in a pigeon, which is in the belly of a
        hare; this hare is in the belly of a wolf, and this wolf is in the
        belly of my brother, who dwells a thousand leagues from here. So I am
        quite easy on that score.”</span> A soldier, the hero of the tale,
        had been of service to an ant, a wolf, and a sea-bird, who in return
        bestowed on him the power of turning himself into an ant, a wolf, or
        a sea-bird at will. By means of this magical power the soldier
        contrived to obtain the egg and crush it on the breast of the giant,
        who immediately expired.<a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href=

        Breton story tells of a giant who was called Body-without-Soul
        because <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name=
        "Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his life did not
        reside in his body. He himself dwelt in a beautiful castle which hung
        between heaven and earth, suspended by four golden chains; but his
        life was in an egg, and the egg was in a dove, and the dove was in a
        hare, and the hare was in a wolf, and the wolf was in an iron chest
        at the bottom of the sea. In his castle in the air he kept prisoner a
        beauteous princess whom he had swooped down upon and carried off in a
        magic chariot. But her lover turned himself into an ant and so
        climbed up one of the golden chains into the enchanted castle, for he
        had done a kindness to the king and queen of ants, and they rewarded
        him by transforming him into an ant in his time of need. When he had
        learned from the captive princess the secret of the giant's life, he
        procured the chest from the bottom of the sea by the help of the king
        of fishes, whom he had also obliged; and opening the chest he killed
        first the wolf, then the hare, and then the dove, and at the death of
        each animal the giant grew weaker and weaker as if he had lost a
        limb. In the stomach of the dove the hero found the egg on which the
        giant's life depended, and when he came with it to the castle he
        found Body-without-Soul stretched on his bed at the point of death.
        So he dashed the egg against the giant's forehead, the egg broke, and
        the giant straightway expired.<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379"
        href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        another Breton tale the life of a giant resides in an old box-tree
        which grows in his castle garden; and to kill him it is necessary to
        sever the tap-root of the tree at a single blow of an axe without
        injuring any of the lesser roots. This task the hero, as usual,
        successfully accomplishes, and at the same moment the giant drops
        dead.<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href=

        Hebrides. We have still to shew that the same idea occurs commonly in
        the popular stories of peoples who do not belong to the Aryan stock.
        In the first place it appears in the ancient Egyptian story of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Two Brothers.”</span> This story was
        written down in the reign of Rameses II., about 1300 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> It is therefore older
        than our present redaction of Homer, and far older than the Bible.
        The outline of the story, so far as it concerns us here, is as
        follows. Once upon a time there were two brethren; the name of the
        elder was Anpu and the name of the younger was Bata. Now Anpu had a
        house and a wife, and his younger brother dwelt with him as his
        servant. It was Anpu who made the garments, and every morning when it
        grew light he drove the kine afield. As he walked behind them they
        used to say to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“The grass is good in
        such and such a place,”</span> and he heard what they said and led
        them to the good pasture that they desired. So his kine grew very
        sleek and multiplied greatly. One day when the two brothers were at
        work in the field the elder brother said to the younger, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Run and fetch seed from the village.”</span> So the
        younger brother ran and said to the wife of his elder brother,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me seed that I may run to the field,
        for my brother sent me saying, Tarry not.”</span> She said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Go to the barn and take as much as thou
        wouldst.”</span> He went and filled a jar full of wheat and barley,
        and came forth bearing it on his shoulders. When the woman saw him
        her heart went out to him, and she laid hold of him and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, let us rest an hour together.”</span>
        But he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art to me as a mother, and
        my brother is to me as a father.”</span> So he would not hearken to
        her, but took the load on his back and went away to the field. In the
        evening, when the elder brother was returning from the field, his
        wife feared for what she had said. So she took soot and made herself
        as one who had been beaten. And when her husband came home, she said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“When thy younger brother came to fetch seed,
        he said to me, Come, let us rest an hour together. But I would not,
        and he beat me.”</span> Then the elder brother became like a panther
        of the south; he sharpened his knife and stood behind the door of the
        cow-house. And when the sun set and the younger brother came laden
        with all the herbs of the field, as was his wont <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> every day, the cow that walked in front
        of the herd said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, thine elder
        brother stands with a knife to kill thee. Flee before him.”</span>
        When he heard what the cow said, he looked under the door of the
        cow-house and saw the feet of his elder brother standing behind the
        door, his knife in his hand. So he fled and his brother pursued him
        with the knife. But the younger brother cried for help to the Sun,
        and the Sun heard him and caused a great water to spring up between
        him and his elder brother, and the water was full of crocodiles. The
        two brothers stood, the one on the one side of the water and the
        other on the other, and the younger brother told the elder brother
        all that had befallen. So the elder brother repented him of what he
        had done and he lifted up his voice and wept. But he could not come
        at the farther bank by reason of the crocodiles. His younger brother
        called to him and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go home and tend the
        cattle thyself. For I will dwell no more in the place where thou art.
        I will go to the Valley of the Acacia. But this is what thou shalt do
        for me. Thou shalt come and care for me, if evil befalls me, for I
        will enchant my heart and place it on the top of the flower of the
        Acacia; and if they cut the Acacia and my heart falls to the ground,
        thou shalt come and seek it, and when thou hast found it thou shalt
        lay it in a vessel of fresh water. Then I shall come to life again.
        But this is the sign that evil has befallen me; the pot of beer in
        thine hand shall bubble.”</span> So he went away to the Valley of the
        Acacia, but his brother returned home with dust on his head and slew
        his wife and cast her to the dogs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For many days
        afterwards the younger brother dwelt alone in the Valley of the
        Acacia. By day he hunted the beasts of the field, but at evening he
        came and laid him down under the Acacia, on the top of whose flower
        was his heart. And many days after that he built himself a house in
        the Valley of the Acacia. But the gods were grieved for him; and the
        Sun said to Khnumu, <span class="tei tei-q">“Make a wife for Bata,
        that he may not dwell alone.”</span> So Khnumu made him a woman to
        dwell with him, who was perfect in her limbs more than any woman on
        earth, for all the gods were in her. So she dwelt with him. But one
        day a lock of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg
        136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> her
        hair fell into the river and floated down to the land of Egypt, to
        the house of Pharaoh's washerwomen. The fragrance of the lock
        perfumed Pharaoh's raiment, and the washerwomen were blamed, for it
        was said, <span class="tei tei-q">“An odour of perfume in the
        garments of Pharaoh!”</span> So the heart of Pharaoh's chief
        washerman was weary of the complaints that were made every day, and
        he went to the wharf, and there in the water he spied the lock of
        hair. He sent one down into the river to fetch it, and, because it
        smelt sweetly, he took it to Pharaoh. Then Pharaoh's magicians were
        sent for and they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“This lock of hair
        belongs to a daughter of the Sun, who has in her the essence of all
        the gods. Let messengers go forth to all foreign lands to seek
        her.”</span> So the woman was brought from the Valley of the Acacia
        with chariots and archers and much people, and all the land of Egypt
        rejoiced at her coming, and Pharaoh loved her. But when they asked
        her of her husband, she said to Pharaoh, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let
        them cut down the Acacia and let them destroy it.”</span> So men were
        sent with tools to cut down the Acacia. They came to it and cut the
        flower upon which was the heart of Bata; and he fell down dead in
        that evil hour. But the next day, when the earth grew light and the
        elder brother of Bata was entered into his house and had sat down,
        they brought him a pot of beer and it bubbled, and they gave him a
        jug of wine and it grew turbid. Then he took his staff and his
        sandals and hied him to the Valley of the Acacia, and there he found
        his younger brother lying dead in his house. So he sought for the
        heart of his brother under the Acacia. For three years he sought in
        vain, but in the fourth year he found it in the berry of the Acacia.
        So he threw the heart into a cup of fresh water. And when it was
        night and the heart had sucked in much water, Bata shook in all his
        limbs and revived. Then he drank the cup of water in which his heart
        was, and his heart went into its place, and he lived as before.<a id=

        the ogres. In the house of the ogres he saw some things hanging from
        the roof, and on asking a female slave what they were, she said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“That is the bottle which contains the life

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Basque story,
        which closely resembles some of the stories told among Aryan peoples,
        relates how a monster—a Body-without-Soul—detains a princess in
        captivity, and is questioned by her as to how he might be slain. With
        some reluctance he tells her, <span class="tei tei-q">“You must kill
        a terrible wolf which is in the forest, and inside him is a fox, in
        the fox is a pigeon; this pigeon has an egg in his head, and whoever
        should strike me on the forehead with this egg would kill me.”</span>
        The hero of the story, by name Malbrouk, has learned, in the usual
        way, the art of turning himself at will into a wolf, an ant, a hawk,
        or a dog, and on the strength of this accomplishment he kills the
        animals, one after the other, and extracts the precious egg from the
        pigeon's head. When the wolf is killed, the monster feels it and says
        despondently, <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not know if anything is
        going to happen to me. I am much afraid of it.”</span> When the fox
        and the pigeon have been killed, he cries that it is all over with
        him, that they have taken the egg out of the pigeon, and that he
        knows not what is to become of him. Finally the princess strikes the
        monster on the forehead with the egg, and he falls a corpse.<a id=

        inside the box one black and one shining beetle: the shining beetle
        held her life, and the black one held her power; if these two beetles
        died, then her life would come to an end also. When the old hag went
        out, Ambrose killed the wild boar, and took out the hare; from the
        hare he took the pigeon, from the pigeon the box, and from the box
        the two beetles; he killed the black beetle, but kept the shining one
        alive. So the witch's power left her immediately, and when she came
        home, she had to take to her bed. Having learned from her how to

        of a giant who slew a man and took away his wife. When the man's son
        grew up, he tried to rescue his mother and kill the giant, but fire
        and sword were powerless to harm the monster; it seemed as if he had
        no life in his body. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dear mother,”</span> at
        last enquired the son, <span class="tei tei-q">“don't you know where
        the giant has hidden away his life?”</span> The mother did not know,
        but promised to ask. So one day, when the giant chanced to be in a
        good humour, she asked him where he kept his life. He said to her,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Out yonder on a burning sea is an island, in
        the island is a barrel, in the barrel is a sheep, in the sheep is a
        hen, in the hen is an egg, and in the egg is my life.”</span> When
        the woman's son heard this, he hired a bear, a wolf, a hawk, and a
        diver-bird and set off in a boat to sail to the island in the burning
        sea. He sat with the hawk and the diver-bird under an iron tent in
        the middle of the boat, and he set the bear and the wolf to row. That
        is why to this day the bear's hair is dark brown and the wolf has
        dark-brown spots; for as they sat at the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> oars without any screen they were naturally
        scorched by the tossing tongues of flame on the burning sea. However,
        they made their way over the fiery billows to the island, and there
        they found the barrel. In a trice the bear had knocked the bottom out
        of it with his claws, and forth sprang a sheep. But the wolf soon
        pulled the sheep down and rent it in pieces. From out the sheep flew
        a hen, but the hawk stooped on it and tore it with his talons. In the
        hen was an egg, which dropped into the sea and sank; but the
        diver-bird dived after it. Twice he dived after it in vain and came
        up to the surface gasping and spluttering; but the third time he
        brought up the egg and handed it to the young man. Great was the
        young man's joy. At once he kindled a great bonfire on the shore,
        threw the egg into it, and rowed away back across the sea. On landing
        he went away straight to the giant's abode, and found the monster
        burning, just as he had left the egg burning on the island.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Fool that I was,”</span> lamented the dying
        giant, <span class="tei tei-q">“to betray my life to a wicked old
        woman,”</span> and with that he snatched at an iron tube through
        which in happier days he had been wont to suck the blood of his human
        victims. But the woman was too subtle for him, for she had taken the
        precaution of inserting one end of the tube in the glowing embers of
        the hearth; and so, when the giant sucked hard at the other end, he
        imbibed only fire and ashes. Thus he burned inside as well as
        outside, and when the fire went out the giant's life went out with
        it.<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A modern Chinese
        story tells how an habitual criminal used to take his soul out of his
        own body for the purpose of evading the righteous punishment of his
        crimes. This bad man lived in Khien (Kwei-cheu), and the sentences
        that had been passed on him formed a pile as high as a hill. The
        mandarins had flogged him to death with sticks and flung his mangled
        corpse into the river, but three days afterwards the scoundrel got
        his soul back again, and on the fifth day he resumed his career of
        villainy as if nothing had happened. The thing occurred again and
        again, till at last it reached the ears of the Governor of the
        province, who flew into a violent passion and proposed to the
        Governor-General to have the rascal beheaded. And beheaded he was;
        but in three days the wretch was alive again with no trace of
        decapitation about him except a slender red thread round his neck.
        And now, like a giant refreshed, he began a fresh series of
        enormities. He even went so far as to beat his own mother. This was
        more than she could bear, and she brought the matter before the
        magistrate. She produced in court a vase and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In this vase my refractory son has hidden his soul.
        Whenever he was conscious of having committed a serious crime, or a
        misdeed of the most heinous kind, he remained at home, took his soul
        out of his body, purified it, and put it in the vase. Then the
        authorities only punished or executed his body of flesh and blood,
        and not his soul. With his soul, refined by a long process, he then
        cured his freshly mutilated body, which thus became able in three
        days to recommence in the old way. Now, however, his crimes have
        reached a climax, for he has beaten me, an old woman, and I cannot
        bear it. I pray you, smash this vase, and <span class="tei tei-pb"

        windwheel; and if then you castigate his body anew, it is probable
        that bad son of mine will really die.”</span> The mandarin took the
        hint. He had the rogue cudgelled to death, and when they examined the
        corpse they found that decay had set in within ten days.<a id=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Khasis of
        Assam tell of a certain Kyllong, king of Madur, who pursued his
        conquests on a remarkable principle. He needed few or no soldiers,
        because he himself was a very strong man and nobody could kill him
        permanently; they could, it is true, put him to death, but then he
        came to life again immediately. The king of Synteng, who was much
        afraid of him, once chopped him in pieces and threw the severed hands
        and feet far away, thinking thus to get rid of him for good and all;
        but it was to no purpose. The very next morning Kyllong came to life
        again and stalked about as brisk as ever. So the king of Synteng was
        very anxious to learn how his rival contrived thus to rise from the
        dead; and he hit on a plan for worming out the secret. He chose the
        fairest girl of the whole country, clad her in royal robes, put
        jewels of gold and silver upon her, and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“All these will I give thee and more besides, if thou
        canst obtain for me King Kyllong's secret, and canst inform me how he
        brings himself to life again after being killed.”</span> So he sent
        the girl to the slave-market in King Kyllong's country; and the king
        saw and loved her and took her to wife. So she caressed him and
        coaxed him to tell her his secret, and in a fatal hour he was
        beguiled into revealing it. He said, <span class="tei tei-q">“My life
        depends upon these things. I must bathe every day and must wash my
        entrails. After that, I take my food, and there is no one on earth
        who can kill me unless he obtains possession of my entrails. Thus my
        life hangs only on my entrails.”</span> His treacherous wife at once
        sent word to the king of Synteng, who caused men to lie in wait while
        Kyllong was bathing. As usual, Kyllong had laid his entrails on one
        side of the bathing-place, while he disported himself in the water,
        intending afterwards to wash them and replace them in his body. But
        before he could do so, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg
        147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> one
        of the liers-in-wait had seized the entrails and killed him. The
        entrails he cut in pieces and gave to the dogs to eat. That was the
        end of King Kyllong. He was never able to come to life again; his
        country was conquered, and the members of the royal family were
        scattered far and wide. Seven generations have passed since
        then.<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href=

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Malay poem
        relates how once upon a time in the city of Indrapoora there was a
        certain merchant who was rich and prosperous, but he had no children.
        One day as he walked with his wife by the river they found a baby
        girl, fair as an angel. So they adopted the child and called her
        Bidasari. The merchant caused a golden fish to be made, and into this
        fish he transferred the soul of his adopted daughter. Then he put the
        golden fish in a golden box full of water, and hid it in a pond in
        the midst of his garden. In time the girl grew to be a lovely woman.
        Now the King of Indrapoora had a fair young queen, who lived in fear
        that the king might take to himself a second wife. So, hearing of the
        charms of Bidasari, the queen resolved to put her out of the way. She
        lured the girl to the palace and tortured her cruelly; but Bidasari
        could not die, because her soul was not in her. At last she could
        stand the torture no longer and said to the queen, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If you wish me to die, you must bring the box which is
        in the pond in my father's garden.”</span> So the box was brought and
        opened, and there was the golden fish in the water. The girl said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“My soul is in that fish. In the morning you
        must take the fish out of the water, and in the evening you must put
        it back into the water. Do not let the fish lie about, but bind it
        round your neck. If you do this, I shall soon die.”</span> So the
        queen took the fish out of the box and fastened it round her neck;
        and no sooner had she done so, than Bidasari fell into a swoon. But
        in the evening, when the fish was put back into the water, Bidasari
        came to herself again. Seeing that she thus had the girl in her
        power, the queen sent her home to her adopted parents. To save her
        from further persecution her parents resolved to remove their
        daughter from the city. So in a lonely and desolate spot they built a
        house and brought Bidasari thither. There she dwelt alone, undergoing
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148"
        id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> vicissitudes that corresponded
        with the vicissitudes of the golden fish in which was her soul. All
        day long, while the fish was out of the water, she remained
        unconscious; but in the evening, when the fish was put into the
        water, she revived. One day the king was out hunting, and coming to
        the house where Bidasari lay unconscious, was smitten with her
        beauty. He tried to waken her, but in vain. Next day, towards
        evening, he repeated his visit, but still found her unconscious.
        However, when darkness fell, she came to herself and told the king
        the secret of her life. So the king returned to the palace, took the
        fish from the queen, and put it in water. Immediately Bidasari
        revived, and the king took her to wife.<a id="noteref_402" name=

        Northern Nigeria closely resembles some of the European tales which
        we have noticed; for it contains not only the incident of the
        external soul, but also the incident of the helpful animals, by whose
        assistance the hero is able to slay the Soulless King and obtain
        possession of the kingdom. The story runs thus. A certain man and his
        wife had four daughters born to them in succession, but <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> every one of the baby girls mysteriously
        disappeared on the day when she was to be weaned; so the parents fell
        under the suspicion of having devoured them. Last of all there was
        born to them a son, who to avoid accidents was left to wean himself.
        One day, as he grew up, the son received a magic lotion from an old
        woman, who told him to rub his eyes with it. He did so, and
        immediately he saw a large house and entering it he found his eldest
        sister married to a bull. She bade him welcome and so did her husband
        the bull; and when he went away, the bull very kindly presented him
        with a lock of his hair as a keepsake. In like manner the lad
        discovered his other three sisters, who were living in wedlock with a
        ram, a dog, and a hawk respectively. All of them welcomed him and
        from the ram, the dog, and the hawk he received tokens of regard in
        the shape of hair or feathers. Then he returned home and told his
        parents of his adventure and how he had found his sisters alive and
        married. Next day he went to a far city, where he made love to the
        Queen and persuaded her to plot with him against the life of the King
        her husband. So she coaxed the King to shew his affection for her by
        <span class="tei tei-q">“taking his own life, and joining it to
        hers.”</span> The unsuspecting husband, as usual, fell into the trap
        set for him by his treacherous wife. He confided to her the secret of
        his life. <span class="tei tei-q">“My life,”</span> said he,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“is behind the city, behind the city in a
        thicket. In this thicket there is a lake; in the lake is a rock; in
        the rock is a gazelle; in the gazelle is a dove; and in the dove is a
        small box.”</span> The Queen divulged the secret to her lover, who
        kindled a fire behind the city and threw into it the hair and
        feathers which he had received from the friendly animals, his
        brothers-in-law. Immediately the animals themselves appeared and
        readily gave their help in the enterprise. The bull drank up the
        lake; the ram broke up the rock; the dog caught the gazelle; the hawk
        captured the dove. So the youth extracted the precious box from the
        dove and repaired to the palace, where he found the King already
        dead. His Majesty had been ailing from the moment when the young man
        left the city, and he grew steadily worse with every fresh success of
        the adventurer who was to supplant him. So the hero became King and
        married the false Queen; and his sisters' <span class="tei tei-pb"

        told by the Ba-Ronga of South Africa sets forth how the lives of a
        whole family were contained in one cat. When a girl of the family,
        named Titishan, married a husband, she begged her parents to let her
        take the precious cat with her to her new home. But they refused,
        saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“You know that our life is attached
        to it”</span>; and they offered to give her an antelope or even an
        elephant instead of it. But nothing would satisfy her but the cat. So
        at last she carried it off with her and shut it up in a place where
        nobody saw it; even her husband knew nothing about it. One day, when
        she went to work in the fields, the cat escaped from its place of
        concealment, entered the hut, put on the warlike trappings of the
        husband, and danced and sang. Some children, attracted by the noise,
        discovered the cat at its antics, and when they expressed their
        astonishment, the animal only capered the more and insulted them
        besides. So they went to the owner and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There is somebody dancing in your house, and he insulted
        us.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Hold your tongues,”</span> said
        he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll soon put a stop to your
        lies.”</span> So he went and hid behind the door and peeped in, and
        there sure enough was the cat prancing about and singing. He fired at
        it, and the animal dropped down dead. At the same moment his wife
        fell to the ground in the field where she was at work; said she,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I have been killed at home.”</span> But she
        had strength enough left to ask her husband to go with her to her
        parents' village, taking with him the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class=

        assembled, and bitterly they reproached her for having insisted on
        taking the animal with her to her husband's village. As soon as the
        mat was unrolled and they saw the dead cat, they all fell down
        lifeless one after the other. So the Clan of the Cat was destroyed;
        and the bereaved husband closed the gate of the village with a
        branch, and returned home, and told his friends how in killing the
        cat he had killed the whole clan, because their lives depended on the
        life of the cat. In another Ronga story the lives of a whole clan are
        attached to a buffalo, which a girl of the clan in like manner

        who healed him of his hurts. When the Indian was about to return to
        his village, the old he-bear said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        shall look after you. I shall give you a part of myself. If I am
        killed, you shall be killed. If I grow old, you shall be old.”</span>
        And the bear gave him a cap of bearskin, and at parting he put his
        arms round the Indian and hugged him, and put his mouth against the
        man's mouth and held the man's hands in his paws. The Indian who told
        the tale conjectured that when the man died, the old bear died
        also.<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href=

        herself into a bear from the prairie wolf. She was a great warrior
        and quite invulnerable; for when she went to war she took out her

        Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia tell of an ogress, who could not
        be killed because her life was in a hemlock branch. A brave boy met
        her in the woods, smashed her head with a stone, scattered her
        brains, broke her bones, and threw them into the water. Then,
        thinking he had disposed of the ogress, he went into her house. There
        he saw a woman rooted to the floor, who warned him, saying,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Now do not stay long. I know that you have
        tried to kill the ogress. It is the fourth time that somebody has

        in that covered hemlock branch is her life. Go there, and as soon as
        you see her enter, shoot her life. Then she will be dead.”</span>
        Hardly had she finished speaking when sure enough in came the ogress,

          is found in the popular tales of many races. It remains to shew
          that the idea is not a mere figment devised to adorn a tale, but is
          a real article of primitive faith, which has given rise to a
          corresponding set of customs.</p>

          removes his soul from his body, in order that his body may be
          invulnerable and immortal in the combat. With a like intention the
          savage removes his soul from his body on various occasions of real
          or imaginary peril. Thus among the people of Minahassa in Celebes,
          when a family moves into a new house, a priest collects the souls
          of the whole family in a bag, and afterwards restores them to their
          owners, because the moment of entering a new house is supposed to
          be fraught with supernatural danger.<a id="noteref_411" name=

          Southern Celebes, when a woman is brought to bed, the messenger who
          fetches the doctor or the midwife always carries with him something
          made of iron, such as a chopping-knife, which he delivers to the
          doctor. The doctor must keep the thing in his house till the
          confinement is over, when he gives it back, receiving a fixed sum
          of money for doing so. The chopping-knife, or whatever it is,
          represents the woman's soul, which at this critical time is
          believed to be safer out of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> her body than in it. Hence the doctor must
          take great care of the object; for were it lost, the woman's soul
          would assuredly, they think, be lost with it.<a id="noteref_412"

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a> But
          in Celebes the convenience of occasionally depositing the soul in
          some external object is apparently not limited to human beings. The
          Alfoors, or Toradjas, who inhabit the central district of that
          island, and among whose industries the working of iron occupies a
          foremost place, attribute to the metal a soul which would be apt to
          desert its body under the blows of the hammer, if some means were
          not found to detain it. Accordingly in every smithy of Poso—for
          that is the name of the country of these people—you may see hanging
          up a bundle of wooden instruments, such as chopping-knives, swords,
          spear-heads, and so forth. This bundle goes by the name of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">lamoa</span></span>, which is the general word
          for <span class="tei tei-q">“gods,”</span> and in it the soul of
          the iron that is being wrought in the smithy is, according to one
          account, supposed to reside. <span class="tei tei-q">“If we did not
          hang the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">lamoa</span></span> over the anvil,”</span>
          they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“the iron would flow away and be
          unworkable,”</span> on account of the absence of the soul.<a id=

          However, according to another interpretation these wooden models
          are substitutes offered to the gods in room of the iron, whose soul
          the covetous deities might otherwise abstract for their own use,
          thus making the metal unmalleable.<a id="noteref_414" name=

          intention of the ceremony is not explained by the writer who
          describes it, but we may conjecture that it is to place the soul of
          the child in a safer place than its own frail little body. This
          conjecture is confirmed by the reason assigned for a similar custom
          observed elsewhere in the Indian Archipelago. In the Kei Islands,
          when there is a newly-born child in a house, an empty coco-nut,
          split and spliced together again, may sometimes be seen hanging
          beside a rough wooden image of an ancestor. The soul of the infant
          is believed to be temporarily deposited in the coco-nut in order
          that it may be safe from the attacks of evil spirits; but when the
          child grows bigger and stronger, the soul will take up its
          permanent abode in its own body. Similarly among the Esquimaux of
          Alaska, when a child is sick, the medicine-man will sometimes
          extract its soul from its body and place it for safe-keeping in an
          amulet, which for further security he deposits in his own
          medicine-bag. <a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href=

          with his hair, and that when his hair is cut off he dies or grows
          weak. So the natives of Amboyna used to think that their strength
          was in their hair and would desert them if it were shorn. A
          criminal under torture in a Dutch Court of that island persisted in
          denying his guilt till his hair was cut off, when he immediately
          confessed. One man, who was tried for murder, endured without
          flinching the utmost ingenuity of his torturers till he saw the
          surgeon standing with a pair of shears. On asking what this was
          for, and being told that it was to cut his hair, he begged they
          would not do it, and made a clean breast. In subsequent cases, when
          torture failed to wring a confession from a prisoner, the Dutch
          authorities made a practice of cutting off his hair.<a id=

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here in Europe
          it used to be thought that the maleficent powers of witches and
          wizards resided in their hair, and that nothing could make any
          impression on these miscreants so long as they kept their hair on.
          Hence in France it was customary to shave the whole bodies of
          persons charged with sorcery before handing them over to the
          torturer. Millaeus witnessed the torture of some persons at
          Toulouse, from whom no confession could be wrung until they were
          stripped and completely shaven, when they readily acknowledged the
          truth of the charge. A woman also, who apparently led a pious life,
          was put to the torture on suspicion of witchcraft, and bore her
          agonies with incredible constancy, until complete depilation drove
          her to admit her guilt. The noted inquisitor Sprenger contented
          himself with shaving the head of the suspected witch or wizard; but
          his more thorough-going colleague Cumanus shaved the whole bodies
          of forty-one women before committing them all to the flames. He had
          high authority for this rigorous scrutiny, since Satan himself, in
          a sermon preached from the pulpit of North Berwick church,
          comforted his many servants by assuring <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class=

          Similarly in Bastar, a province of India, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“if a man is adjudged guilty of witchcraft, he is
          beaten by the crowd, his hair is shaved, the hair being supposed to
          constitute his power of mischief, his front teeth are knocked out,
          in order, it is said, to prevent him from muttering
          incantations.... Women suspected of sorcery have to undergo the
          same ordeal; if found guilty, the same punishment is awarded, and
          after being shaved, their hair is attached to a tree in some public
          place.”</span><a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href=

          among the Bhils of India, when a woman was convicted of witchcraft
          and had been subjected to various forms of persuasion, such as
          hanging head downwards from a tree and having pepper put into her
          eyes, a lock of hair was cut from her head and buried in the
          ground, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the last link between her and

          <span class="tei tei-q">“had done their evil deeds, and the time
          came to put an end to their detestable life, some one laid hold of

          Similarly among the natives of the Pennefather River in Queensland,

          <span class="tei tei-q">“the trees were carefully guarded and

          are born on the same day, the people plant two trees of the same

          believed to be bound up with the life of one of the trees; and if
          the tree dies or is thrown down, they are sure that the child will

          The plant is thenceforth carefully tended, for they believe that
          were it to wither away the child would die. When the navel-string
          drops from the infant, it is buried under the plant. The species of
          birth-plant varies with the clan; members of one clan, for example,
          plant a particular sort of banana, members of another clan plant a
          sugar-cane, and so on.<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href=

          Seven days afterwards, the hair of the child is shaved and
          deposited, along with the clippings of its nails, in the same
          place. Then over all these relics of the infant's person a coco-nut
          is planted. As the tree grows up from the nut, the child likes to
          point it out to his playfellows and tell them, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This coco-nut palm is my navel.”</span> In planting
          the coco-nut the parents say, <span class="tei tei-q">“May God

          Though it is not expressly affirmed, we may perhaps assume that
          such a birth-tree is supposed to stand in a sympathetic relation
          with the life of the person. In the Cameroons, also, the life of a

          the Baganda of Central Africa a child's afterbirth was called the
          second child and was believed to be animated by a spirit, which at
          once became a ghost. The afterbirth was usually buried at the root
          of a banana tree, and afterwards the tree was carefully guarded by
          old women, who prevented any one from going near it; they tied
          ropes of fibre from tree to tree to isolate it, and all the child's
          excretions were thrown into this enclosure. When the fruit ripened,
          it was cut by the old woman in charge. The reason for guarding the
          tree thus carefully was a belief that if any stranger were to eat
          of the fruit of the tree or to drink beer brewed from it, he would
          carry off with him the ghost of the child's afterbirth, which had
          been buried at the root of the banana-tree, and the living child
          would then die in order to follow its twin ghost. Whereas a
          grandparent of the child, by eating the fruit or drinking the beer,
          averted this catastrophe and ensured the health of the child.<a id=

          Southern Celebes, when a child is born, a coco-nut is planted and
          watered with the water in which the afterbirth and navel-string

          certain occasions the Dyaks of Borneo plant a palm-tree, which is
          believed to be a complete index of their fate. If it flourishes,
          they reckon on good fortune; but if it withers or dies, they expect
          misfortune.<a id="noteref_451" name="noteref_451" href=

          Amongst the Dyaks of Landak and Tajan, districts of Dutch Borneo,
          it is customary to plant a fruit-tree for a child, and henceforth
          in the popular belief the fate of the child is bound up with that
          of the tree. If the tree shoots up rapidly, it will go well with
          the child; but if the tree is dwarfed or shrivelled, nothing but
          misfortune can be expected for its human counterpart.<a id=

          According to another account, at the naming of children and certain
          other festivals the Dyaks are wont to set a <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sawang</span></span>-plant, roots and all,
          before a priestess; and when the festival is over, the plant is
          replaced in the ground. Such a plant becomes thenceforth a sort of
          prophetic index for the person in whose honour the festival was
          held. If the plant thrives, the man will be fortunate; if it fades
          or perishes, some evil will befall him.<a id="noteref_453" name=

          Dyaks also believe that at the birth of every person on earth a
          flower grows up in the spirit world and leads a life parallel to
          his. If the flower flourishes, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the man enjoys good health, but if it droops,
          so does he. Hence when he has dreamed bad dreams or has felt unwell
          for several days, he infers that his flower in the other world is
          neglected or sickly, and accordingly he employs a medicine-man to
          tend the precious plant, weed the soil, and sweep it up, in order
          that the earthly and unearthly life may prosper once more.<a id=

          the house of Hanover, on a calm summer afternoon, without any
          visible cause, the veteran suddenly fell with a crash and lay
          stretched across the highroad. The peasants regarded its fall as an
          ill omen for the reigning family, and when King George V. heard of

          the last refinement of the gardener's skill, being clipped and
          distorted into a variety of grotesque shapes. Only one of the trees
          remained intact and had been spared these deformations for
          centuries. Far from being stunted by the axe or the shears, the

          the cleft in the tree closes up, so the rupture in the child's body
          will be healed; but that if the rift in the tree remains open, the
          rupture in the child will remain too, and if the tree were to die,
          the death of the child would surely follow.<a id="noteref_470"

          second half of the nineteenth century the remedy was still in
          common use at Fittleworth and many other places in Sussex. The
          account of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg
          170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Sussex practice and belief is notable because it brings out very
          clearly the sympathetic relation supposed to exist between the
          ruptured child and the tree through which it has been passed. We
          are told that the patient <span class="tei tei-q">“must be passed
          nine times every morning on nine successive days at sunrise through
          a cleft in a sapling ash-tree, which has been so far given up by
          the owner of it to the parents of the child, as that there is an
          understanding it shall not be cut down during the life of the
          infant who is to be passed through it. The sapling must be sound at
          heart, and the cleft must be made with an axe. The child on being
          carried to the tree must be attended by nine persons, each of whom
          must pass it through the cleft from west to east. On the ninth
          morning the solemn ceremony is concluded by binding the tree
          lightly with a cord, and it is supposed that as the cleft closes
          the health of the child will improve. In the neighbourhood of
          Petworth some cleft ash-trees may be seen, through which children
          have very recently been passed. I may add, that only a few weeks
          since, a person who had lately purchased an ash-tree standing in
          this parish, intending to cut it down, was told by the father of a
          child, who had some time before been passed through it, that the
          infirmity would be sure to return upon his son if it were felled.
          Whereupon the good man said, he knew that such would be the case;
          and therefore he would not fell it for the world.”</span><a id=

          been commonly practised in other parts of Europe, as Germany,

          sometimes a willow-tree is allowed or even prescribed instead. With
          these exceptions the practice and the belief are nearly the same on
          the Continent as in England: a young oak is split longitudinally
          and the two sides held forcibly apart while the sick child is
          passed through the cleft; then the opening in the tree is closed,
          and bound up, and it is believed that as the cleft in the tree

          simultaneously cured. It is often laid down that the ceremony must

          it seems that in ridding himself of the disease the sufferer is
          supposed to transfer a certain vital part of his person to the tree
          so that it is impossible to injure the tree without at the same
          time injuring the man; and in Rügen this partial union is thought
          to be completed by the transmigration of the man's soul at death
          into the tree. Apparently the disease is conceived as something
          physical, which clings to the patient but can be stripped off him
          and left behind on the farther side of the narrow aperture through
          which he has forced his way; when the aperture is closed by the
          natural growth of the tree, the door is as it <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were shut against the disease, which is
          then unable to pursue and overtake the sufferer. Hence the idea at
          the root of the custom is not so much that the patient has
          transferred his ailment to the tree, as that the tree forms an
          impervious barrier between him and the malady which had hitherto
          afflicted him. This interpretation is confirmed by the following
          parallels.</p>

          Apparently, they think that evil spirits cannot creep through the
          cleft in the holy tree, and therefore that the sick who have
          effected the passage are safe from their demoniacal pursuers. The
          same conception of a fissure in a tree as an obstacle placed in the
          path of pursuing spirits meets us in a number of savage customs.
          Thus in the island of Nias, when a man is in training for the
          priesthood, he has to be introduced to the various spirits between
          whom and mankind it will be his office to mediate. A priest takes
          him to an open window, and while the drums are beating points out
          to him the great spirit in the sun who calls away men to himself
          through death; for it is needful that the future priest should know
          him from whose grasp he will often be expected to wrest the sick
          and dying. In the evening twilight he is led to the graves and
          shewn the envious spirits of the dead, who also are ever drawing
          away the living to their own shadowy world. Next day he is
          conducted to a river and shewn the spirit of the waters; and
          finally they take him up to a mountain and exhibit to him the
          spirits of the mountains, who have diverse shapes, some appearing
          like swine, others like buffaloes, others like goats, and others
          again like men with long hair on their bodies. When he has seen all
          this, his education is complete, but on his return from the
          mountain the new priest may not at once enter his own house. For
          the people think that, were he to do so, the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dangerous spirits by whom he is still
          environed would stay in the house and visit both the family and the
          pigs with sickness. Accordingly he betakes himself to other
          villages and passes several nights there, hoping that the spirits
          will leave him and settle on the friends who receive him into their
          houses; but naturally he does not reveal the intention of his
          visits to his hosts. Lastly, before he enters his own dwelling, he
          looks out for some young tree by the way, splits it down the
          middle, and then creeps through the fissure, in the belief that any
          spirit which may still be clinging to him will thus be left
          sticking to the tree.<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href=

          Again, among the Bilqula or Bella Coola Indians of British Columbia
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the bed of a mourner must be protected
          against the ghost of the deceased. His male relatives stick a
          thorn-bush into the ground at each corner of their beds. After four
          days these are thrown into the water. Mourners must rise early and
          go into the woods, where they stick four thorn-bushes into the
          ground, at the corners of a square, in which they cleanse
          themselves by rubbing their bodies with cedar branches. They also
          swim in ponds. After swimming they cleave four small trees and
          creep through the clefts, following the course of the sun. This
          they do on four subsequent mornings, cleaving new trees every day.
          Mourners cut their hair short. The hair that has been cut off is
          burnt. If they should not observe these regulations, it is believed
          that they would dream of the deceased.”</span><a id="noteref_481"

          the savage, who fails to distinguish the visions of sleep from the

          "Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> appearances of
          waking life, the apparition of a dead man in a dream is equivalent
          to the actual presence of the ghost; and accordingly he seeks to
          keep off the spiritual intruder, just as he might a creature of
          flesh and blood, by fencing his bed with thorn-bushes. Similarly
          the practice of creeping through four cleft trees is clearly an
          attempt to shake off the clinging ghost and leave it adhering to
          the trees, just as in Nias the future priest hopes to rid himself
          in like manner of the dangerous spirits who have dogged his steps
          from the mountains and the graves.</p>

          ceremony which Dr. Charles Hose witnessed at the chief village of

          district in the heart of Borneo. <span class="tei tei-q">“Just
          across the river from where we were sitting,”</span> says Dr. Hose,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“was the graveyard, and there I witnessed a
          funeral procession as the day was drawing to a close. The coffin,
          which was a wooden box made from a tree-trunk, was decorated with
          red and black patterns in circles, with two small wooden figures of
          men placed at either end; it was lashed with rattans to a long
          pole, and by this means was lifted to the shoulders of the bearers,
          who numbered thirteen in all, and who then carried it to the
          burying-ground. After the mourners had all passed over to the
          graveyard, a man quickly cut a couple of small sticks, each five
          feet long and about an inch in diameter. One of these he split
          almost the whole way down, and forced the unsplit end into the
          ground, when the upper part opened like a V, leaving sufficient
          room for each person to pass through. He next split the top of the
          other stick, and, placing another short stick in the cleft, made a
          cross, which he also forced into the ground. The funeral procession
          climbed the mound on which the cemetery was situated, passing
          through the V of the cleft stick in single file. As soon as the
          coffin had been placed on the stage erected for the purpose, the
          people commenced their return, following on one another's heels as
          quickly as possible, each spitting out the words, <span class=

          passed through the V-shaped stick. The whole party having

          the gate was closed by the simple process of tying the cleft ends
          of the stick together, and a few words were then said to the
          cross-stick, which they call <span class=

          "font-style: italic">ngring</span></span>, or the wall that
          separates the living from the dead. All who had taken part in the
          ceremony then went and bathed before returning to their homes,
          rubbing their skins with rough pebbles, the old Mosaic idea of the
          uncleanness of the dead, as mentioned in Numbers (chap. xix.),
          evidently finding a place among their religious beliefs. It is
          apparently a great relief to their minds to think that they can
          shut out the spirit of the deceased. They believe that the spirit
          of the dead is not aware that life has left the body until a short
          time after the coffin has been taken to the graveyard, and then not
          until the spirit has had leisure to notice the clothes, weapons,
          and other articles belonging to its earthly estate, which are

          through the cleft stick is strictly analogous to the passage of
          ruptured English children through a cleft ash-tree. Both are simply
          ways of leaving an evil thing behind. Similarly the subsequent
          binding up of the cloven stick in Borneo is analogous to the
          binding up of the cloven ash-tree in England. Both are ways of
          barricading the road against the evil which is dogging your steps;
          having passed through the doorway you slam the door in the face of
          your pursuer. Yet it seems probable that the intention of binding
          up the cleft in a tree through which a ruptured patient has been
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name=
          "Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> passed is not merely
          that of shutting the door on the malady conceived as a personal
          being; combined with this idea is perhaps the notion that in virtue
          of the law of magical homoeopathy the rupture in the body of the
          sufferer will close up exactly in the same measure as the cleft in
          the tree closes up through the force of bandages and of natural
          growth. That this shade of meaning attaches to the custom is
          rendered probable by a comparison of an ancient Roman cure for
          dislocation, which has been preserved for us by the grave authority
          of the elder Cato. He recommended that a green reed, four or five
          feet long, should be taken, split down the middle, and held by two
          men to the dislocated bones while a curious and now unintelligible
          spell was recited; then, when the spell had been recited and the
          aperture in the reed had closed, the reed was to be tied to the
          dislocated limb, and a perfect cure might be expected. Apparently
          it was supposed that just as the two sides of the split reed came
          together and coalesced after being held apart, so the dislocated
          bones would come together and fit into their proper places.<a id=

          idea in passing through a narrow aperture as a cure or preventive
          of evil would seem to be simply that of giving the slip to a

          of Tonquin repair after a burial to the banks of a stream and there
          creep through a triangle formed by leaning two reeds against each
          other, while the sorcerer souses them with dirty water. All the

          again we cannot doubt that the creeping through the triangle of
          reeds is intended to rid the mourners of the troublesome ghost. So
          when the Kamtchatkans had disposed of a corpse after their usual
          fashion by throwing it to the dogs to be devoured, they purified
          themselves as follows. They went into the forest and cut various
          roots which they bent into rings, and through these rings they
          crept twice. Afterwards they carried the rings back to the forest
          and flung them away westward. The Koryaks, a people of the same
          region, burn their dead and hold a festival in honour of the
          departed a year after the death. At this festival, which takes
          place on the spot where the corpse was burned, or, if that is too
          far off, on a neighbouring height, they sacrifice two young
          reindeer which have never been in harness, and the sorcerer sticks
          a great many reindeer horns in the earth, believing that thereby he
          is dispatching a whole herd of these animals to their deceased
          friend in the other world. Then they all hasten home, and purify
          themselves by passing between two poles planted in the ground,
          while the sorcerer strikes them with a stick and adjures death not
          to carry them off.<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href=

          homewards after the festival they pass under two poles placed in a

          at the house where the death occurred. <span class="tei tei-q">“In

          through which as usual the spirit cannot follow him.</p>

          may safely assume that when people creep through rings after a
          death or pass between poles after a sacrifice to the dead, their
          intention simply is to interpose a barrier between themselves and
          the ghost; they make their way through a narrow pass or aperture
          through which they hope that the ghost will not be able to follow
          them. To put it otherwise, they conceive that the spirit of the
          dead is sticking to them like a burr, and that like a burr it may
          be rubbed or scraped off and left adhering to the sides of the
          opening through which they have squeezed themselves.</p>

          sick man with its blood, on his forehead, on each side of his
          chest, and on his legs above the knees. The plantain-tree selected
          had to be one that was about to bear fruit, and the medicine-man
          would split the stem from near the top to near the bottom, leaving
          a few inches not split both at the top and at the bottom; the split
          stem would be held open so that the sick man could step through it,

          and would run into the house without looking back. When he entered
          the house, new clothes would be given him to wear. The plantain,
          the clothing, and meat would be carried away by the medicine-man,
          who would deposit the plantain-tree on waste land, but would take
          the meat and clothing for himself. Sometimes the medicine-man would
          kill the animal near the hut, lay a stout stick across the
          threshold, and narrow the doorway by partially filling it with
          branches of trees; he would then put some of the blood on either

          would also anoint with it the sick man, who would be taken outside
          for the purpose. The patient would then re-enter the house, letting
          his clothing fall off, as he passed through the doorway. The
          medicine-man would carry away the branches, the stick, the

          the notion of transferring the sickness to the animal is plainly

          the ailment is left behind adhering to the cleft plantain-stem or
          to the stick and branches of the narrow opening through which the
          patient has made his way. That obviously is why the plantain-stem
          or the stick and branches are thrown away on waste land, lest they

          primitive tribe in the Mandailing district of Sumatra, stand in
          great fear of the wandering spirits of the dead (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">soemangots</span></span>). But <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“they know all sorts of means of protecting themselves
          against the unwelcome visits of the spirits. For example, if a man
          has lost his way in the forest, he thinks that this is the work of
          such a spirit (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">soemangot</span></span>), who dogs the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name=
          "Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> wanderer and bedims
          his sight. So in order to throw the malignant spirit off the track
          he takes a rattan and splits it through the middle. By bending the
          rattan an opening is made, through which he creeps. After that the
          rattan is quickly stretched and the opening closes. By this
          procedure the spirit (so they think) cannot find the opening again
          and so cannot further follow his victim.”</span><a id="noteref_498"

          therefore, the passage through a cleft stick is conceived in the
          clearest way as an escape from a spiritual pursuer, and the closing
          of the aperture when the fugitive has passed through it is nothing
          but the slamming of the door in the face of his invisible foe.</p>

          significance is probably to be attached to other cases of
          ceremonially passing through a cleft stick even where the intention

          German South-West Africa young women who have become marriageable
          perform a variety of ceremonies; among other things they dance in
          the large and the small cattle-kraal. On quitting the large
          cattle-kraal after the dance, and on entering and quitting the
          small cattle-kraal, they are obliged to pass, one after the other,

          the Washamba of German East Africa, when a boy has been
          circumcised, two women bring a long sugar-cane, which still bears

          lower ends and the two sides are held apart so as to form a cleft

          mode of curing or preventing disease. Thus in Sweden, when a
          natural ring has been found in a tree, it is carefully removed and
          treasured in the family; for sick and especially rickety children
          are healed by merely passing through it.<a id="noteref_501" name=

          young married woman in Sweden, who suffered from an infirmity, was
          advised by a wise woman to steal three branches of willow, make
          them into a hoop, and creep through it naked, taking care not to
          touch the hoop and to keep perfectly silent. The hoop was
          afterwards to be burnt. She carried out the prescription
          faithfully, and her faith was rewarded by a perfect cure.<a id=

          doubt her infirmity was thought to adhere to the hoop and to be
          burnt with it. Similarly in Scotland children who suffered from
          hectic fever and consumptive patients used to be healed by passing
          thrice through a circular wreath of woodbine, which was cut during
          the increase of the March moon and was let down over the body of
          the sufferer from the head to the feet. Thus Jonet Stewart cured
          sundry women by <span class="tei tei-q">“taking ane garland of
          grene woodbynd, and causing the patient pas thryis throw it, quhilk

          Another wise woman transmitted the sick <span class=

          warding off the witches and fairies, who are especially dreaded at
          these seasons, and against whose malignant arts the rowan-tree
          affords an efficient protection. In Oldenburg when a cow gives
          little or no milk, they milk her through a hole in a branch. In
          Eversten they say that this should be done through a ring which an
          oak-tree has formed round the scar where a branch has been sawn
          off. Others say the beast should be milked through a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“witch's nest,”</span> that is, through the boughs of a
          birch-tree which have grown in a tangle. Such a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“witch's nest”</span> is also hung up in a pig's stye
          to protect the pig against witchcraft.<a id="noteref_505" name=

          the aim of milking a cow through a <span class="tei tei-q">“witch's

          deliver the poor creature from an artful witch who has been
          draining away the milk into her own pail, as witches are too apt to
          do. Again, in Oldenburg sick children, and also adults and animals,
          are passed through a ring of rough unwashed yarn, just as it comes
          from the reel. To complete the cure you should throw a hot coal
          thrice through the ring, then spit through it thrice, and finally
          bury the yarn under a stone, where you leave it to rot. The writer
          who reports these remedies explains them as intended to strip the
          witchcraft, as you might say, from the bodies of the victims,
          whether human or animal, on whom the witch has cast her
          spell.<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href=

          puts his head through the ring and then moves the ring downwards
          over his body till it has almost reached his feet, when he steps
          out of it, right foot first. They think that this prevents the

          number of large stones may be seen planted in the ground about a

          immemorial people used to assemble at Dourgne and the neighbourhood
          every year on the sixth of August, the festival of St. Estapin. The
          palsied, the lame, the blind, the sick of all sorts, flocked
          thither to seek and find a cure for their various infirmities. Very
          early in the morning they set out from the villages where they had
          lodged or from the meadows where for want of better accommodation
          they had been forced to pass the night, and went on pilgrimage to
          the chapel of St. Estapin, which stands in a gorge at the southern
          foot of the mountain. Having gone nine times in procession round
          the chapel, they hobbled, limped, or crawled to the tableland on
          the top of the mountain. There each of them chose a stone with a
          hole of the requisite size and thrust his ailing member through the
          hole. For there are holes to suit every complaint; some for the
          head, some for the arm, some for the leg, and so on. Having
          performed this simple ceremony they were cured; the lame walked,
          the blind saw, the palsied recovered the use of their limbs, and so
          on. The chapel of the saint is adorned with the crutches and other
          artificial aids, now wholly superfluous, which the joyful pilgrims

          Fünen in Denmark, as late as the latter part of the nineteenth
          century, a cure for childish ailments was to dig up several sods,
          arrange them so as to form a hole, and then to pass the sick child
          through it.<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href=

          simplified form of this cure is adopted in Jutland. At twelve
          o'clock on a Thursday night you go to a churchyard, dig up a
          circular piece of turf, and make a hole in it large enough to
          permit the passage through it of your infant progeny. Taking the
          sod with you, go home, salute nobody on the way, and speak to
          nobody. On getting to your house, take the child and pass it thrice
          through the turf from right to left; then take the turf back to the
          churchyard and replace it in position. If the turf takes root and
          grows afresh, the child will recover; but if the turf withers,
          there is no hope. Elsewhere it is at the hour of sunset rather than
          of midnight that people cut the turf in the churchyard. The same
          cure is applied to cattle which have been bewitched; though
          naturally in that case you must cut a much bigger turf and make a
          much bigger hole in it to let a horse or a cow through than is
          necessary for an infant.<a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531"
          href="#note_531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          again, the conception of a sympathetic relation, established

          the sufferer and the thing which has rid him of his ailment, comes
          out clearly in the belief, that if the turf through which the child
          has been passed thrives, the child will thrive also, but that if
          the turf withers, the child will die. Among the Corannas, a people
          of the Hottentot race on the Orange River, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“when a child recovers from a dangerous illness, a
          trench is dug in the ground, across the middle of which an arch is
          thrown, and an ox made to stand upon it; the child is then dragged
          under the arch. After this ceremony the animal is killed, and eaten
          by married people who have children, none else being permitted to
          participate of the feast.”</span><a id="noteref_532" name=

          the attempt to leave the sickness behind in the hole, which is
          probably the essence of the ceremony, may perhaps be combined with
          an endeavour to impart to the child the strength and vigour of the
          animal. Ancient India seems also to have been familiar with the
          same primitive notion that sickness could, as it were, be stripped
          off the person of the sufferer by passing him through a narrow
          aperture; for in the Rigveda it is said that Indra cured Apala of a
          disease of the skin by drawing her through the yoke of the chariot;

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the small
          village of Damun, on the Kabenau river, in German New Guinea, a
          traveller witnessed the natives performing a ceremony of
          initiation, of which the following rite formed part. The candidates
          for initiation, six in number, were boys and lads of various ages
          from about four years of age to sixteen or seventeen. The company
          betook themselves to the bed of a small stream, where at the end of
          a gully a hollow in the rocks formed a natural basin. At the
          entrance to the gully a sort of yoke, so the traveller calls it,
          was erected by means of some poles, and from the cross-piece plants
          were hung so as to make an arch. One of the men took up his station
          in front of the arch, and as each candidate came up, the man seized
          him, spat on his breast and back a clot of red spittle, and gave
          him several severe blows with the stock of a plant. After that the
          candidate, who had previously stripped himself naked, passed under
          the leafy arch and bathed in the rocky pool at the other end of the
          gully. All the time that this solemnity was proceeding another man
          sat perched on a neighbouring rock, beating a drum and singing.
          Only men took part in the ceremony.<a id="noteref_534" name=

          Though no explanation of the ceremony is given by the observer who
          witnessed it, we may suppose that by passing under the yoke or arch
          the novices were supposed to rid themselves of certain evil
          influences, whether conceived as spiritual or not, which they left
          behind them on the further side of the barrier. This interpretation
          is confirmed by the bath which each candidate took immediately
          afterwards. In short the whole purpose of the rite would seem to
          have been purificatory.</p>

          designed to rid the foe of some uncanny powers before dismissing
          him to his home. For apparently the ceremony was only observed with
          prisoners who were about to be released;<a id="noteref_535" name=

          it been a mere mark of ignominy, there seems to be no reason why it
          should not have been inflicted also on men who were doomed to die.
          This conjectural explanation of the ceremony is confirmed by the
          tradition that the Roman Horatius was similarly obliged by his
          fellow-countrymen to pass under a yoke as a form of purification
          for the murder of his sister. The yoke by passing under which he
          cleansed himself from his sister's blood was still to be seen in
          Rome when Livy was writing his history under the emperor Augustus.
          It was an ancient wooden beam spanning a narrow lane in an old
          quarter of the city, the two ends of the beam being built into the
          masonry of the walls on either side; it went by the name of the
          Sister's Beam, and whenever the wood decayed and threatened to
          fall, the venerable monument, which carried back the thoughts of
          passers-by to the kingly age of Rome, was repaired at the public
          expense.<a id="noteref_536" name="noteref_536" href=

          our interpretation of these customs is right, it was the ghost of
          his murdered sister whom the Roman hero gave the slip to by passing
          under the yoke; and it may have been the angry ghosts of
          slaughtered <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg

          of this work we saw that homicides in general and victorious
          warriors in particular are often obliged to perform a variety of
          ceremonies for the purpose of ridding them of the dangerous ghosts
          of their victims.<a id="noteref_537" name="noteref_537" href=

          the ceremony of passing under the yoke was primarily designed, as I
          have suggested, to free the soldiers from the angry ghosts of the
          men whom they had slain, we should expect to find that the
          victorious Romans themselves observed a similar ceremony after a
          battle for a similar purpose. Was this the original meaning of
          passing under a triumphal arch? In other words, may not the
          triumphal arch have been for the victors what the yoke was for the
          vanquished, a barrier to protect them against the pursuit of the
          spirits of the slain? That the Romans felt the need of purification
          from the taint of bloodshed after a battle appears from the opinion
          of Masurius, mentioned by Pliny, that the laurel worn by soldiers
          in a triumphal procession was intended to purge them from the
          slaughter of the enemy.<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in practice,
          as in folk-tales, it is not merely with inanimate objects and
          plants that a person is occasionally believed to be united by a
          bond of physical sympathy. The same bond, it is supposed, may exist
          between a man and an animal, so that the welfare of the one depends
          on the welfare of the other, and when the animal dies the man dies
          also. The analogy between the custom and the tales is all the
          closer because in both of them the power of thus removing the soul
          from the body and stowing it away in an animal is often a special
          privilege of wizards and witches. Thus the Yakuts of Siberia
          believe that every shaman or wizard keeps his soul, or one of his
          souls, incarnate in an animal which is carefully concealed from all
          the world. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nobody can find my external
          soul,”</span> said one famous wizard, <span class="tei tei-q">“it
          lies hidden far away in the stony mountains of Edzhigansk.”</span>
          Only once a year, when the last snows melt and the earth turns
          black, do these external souls of wizards appear in the shape of
          animals among the dwellings of men. They wander everywhere, yet
          none but wizards can see them. The strong ones sweep roaring and
          noisily along, the weak steal about quietly and furtively. Often
          they fight, and then the wizard whose external soul is beaten,
          falls ill or dies. The weakest and most cowardly wizards are they
          whose souls are incarnate in the shape of dogs, for the dog gives
          his human double no peace, but gnaws his heart and tears his body.
          The most powerful wizards are they whose external souls have the
          shape of stallions, elks, black bears, eagles, or boars. Again, the
          Samoyeds of the Turukhinsk region hold that every shaman has a
          familiar spirit in the shape of a boar, which he leads about by a
          magic belt. On the death of the boar the shaman himself dies; and
          stories are told of battles between <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          before they encounter each other in person.<a id="noteref_541"
          name="noteref_541" href="#note_541"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a> In
          Yorkshire witches are thought to stand in such peculiarly close
          relations to hares, that if a particular hare is killed or wounded,
          a certain witch will at the same moment be killed or receive a hurt
          in her body exactly corresponding to the wound in the hare.<a id=
          "noteref_542" name="noteref_542" href="#note_542"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">542</span></span></a>
          However, this fancy is probably a case of the general European
          belief that witches have the power of temporarily transforming
          themselves into certain animals, particularly hares and cats, and
          that any hurts inflicted on such transformed animals are felt by
          the witches who are concealed in the animals.<a id="noteref_543"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a> But
          the notion that a person can temporarily transform himself into an
          animal differs from the notion that he can deposit his soul for a
          longer or shorter period in an animal, while he himself retains the
          human form; though in the cloudy mind of the peasant and the savage
          the two ideas may not always be sharply distinguished. The Malays
          believe that <span class="tei tei-q">“the soul of a person may pass
          into another person or into an animal, or rather that such a
          mysterious relation can arise between the two that the fate of the
          one is wholly dependent on that of the other.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Melanesians of Mota, one of the New Hebrides islands, the
          conception of an external soul is carried out in the practice of
          daily life. The Mota word for soul is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">atai</span></span>. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The use of the word <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">atai</span></span> in Mota seems properly and
          originally to have been to signify something peculiarly and
          intimately connected with a person and sacred to him, something
          that he has set his fancy upon when he has seen it in what has
          seemed to him a wonderful manner, or some one has shewn it to him
          as such. Whatever the thing might be the man believed it to be the
          reflection of his own personality; he and his <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">atai</span></span> flourished, suffered,
          lived, and died together. But the word must not be supposed to have
          been borrowed from this use and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> applied secondarily to describe the soul; the
          word carries a sense with it which is applicable alike to that
          second self, the visible object so mysteriously connected with the
          man, and to this invisible second self which we call the soul.
          There is another Mota word, <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span>, which has almost if not
          quite the same meaning as <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">atai</span></span>
          has when it describes something animate or inanimate which a man
          has come to believe to have an existence intimately connected with
          his own. The word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span> may be taken to be
          properly <span class="tei tei-q">‘likeness,’</span> and the noun
          form of the adverb <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tama</span></span>, as, like. It was not every
          one in Mota who had his <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span>; only some men fancied
          that they had this relation to a lizard, a snake, or it might be a
          stone; sometimes the thing was sought for and found by drinking the
          infusion of certain leaves and heaping together the dregs; then
          whatever living thing was first seen in or upon the heap was the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span>. It was watched but not
          fed or worshipped; the natives believed that it came at call, and
          that the life of the man was bound up with the life of his
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span>, if a living thing, or
          with its safety; should it die, or if not living get broken or be
          lost, the man would die. Hence in case of sickness they would send
          to see if the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span> was safe and well. This
          word has never been used apparently for the soul in Mota; but in
          Aurora in the New Hebrides it is the accepted equivalent. It is
          well worth observing that both the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">atai</span></span> and the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span>, and it may be added the
          Motlav <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">talegi</span></span>, is something which has a
          substantial existence of its own, as when a snake or stone is a
          man's <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">atai</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span>; a soul then when called
          by these names is conceived of as something in a way
          substantial.”</span><a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this
          account, which we owe to the careful and accurate researches of the
          Rev. Dr. Codrington, we gather that while every person in Mota has
          a second self or external soul in a visible object called an
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">atai</span></span>, only some people have, it

          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span>. We may conjecture that
          persons who have a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span> in addition to an
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">atai</span></span> are more than <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> usually anxious as to the state of
          their soul, and that they seek to put it in perfect security by
          what we may call a system of double insurance, calculating that if
          one of their external souls should die or be broken, they
          themselves may still survive by virtue of the survival of the
          other. Be that as it may, the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span> discharges two
          functions, one of them defensive and the other offensive. On the
          one hand, so long as it lives or remains unbroken, it preserves its
          owner in life; and on the other hand it helps him to injure his
          enemies. In its offensive character, if the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span> happens to be an eel, it
          will bite its owner's enemy; if it is a shark, it will swallow him.
          In its defensive character, the state of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tamaniu</span></span> is a symptom or
          life-token of the state of the man; hence when he is ill he will
          visit and examine it, or if he cannot go himself he will send
          another to inspect it and report. In either case the man turns the
          animal, if animal it be, carefully over in order to see what is the
          matter with it; should something be found sticking to its skin, it
          is removed, and through the relief thus afforded to the creature
          the sick man recovers. But if the animal should be found dying, it
          is an omen of death for the man; for whenever it dies he dies
          also.<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546" href=

          the latter part of the nineteenth century two English missionaries,
          established at San Salvador, the capital of the King of Congo,
          asked the natives repeatedly whether any of them had seen the
          strange, big, East African goat which Stanley had given to a chief
          at Stanley Pool in 1877. But their enquiries were fruitless; no
          native would admit that he had seen the goat. Some years afterwards
          the missionaries discovered why they could obtain no reply to their
          enquiry. All the people, it turned out, imagined that the
          missionaries believed the spirit of the King of Salvador to be
          contained in the goat, and that they wished to obtain possession of
          the animal in order to exercise an evil influence on his
          majesty.<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href=

          belief from the standpoint of the Congo savages was natural enough,
          since in that region some chiefs regularly link their fate to that
          of an animal. Thus the Chief Bankwa of Ndolo, on the Moeko River,
          had conferred this honour on a certain hippopotamus of the
          neighbourhood, at which he would allow nobody to shoot.<a id=

          the village of Ongek, in the Gaboon, a French missionary slept in
          the hut of an old Fan chief. Awakened about two <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the morning by a rustling of dry
          leaves, he lit a torch, when to his horror he perceived a huge
          black serpent of the most dangerous sort, coiled in a corner, with
          head erect, shining eyes, and hissing jaws, ready to dart at him.
          Instinctively he seized his gun and pointed it at the reptile, when
          suddenly his arm was struck up, the torch was extinguished, and the
          voice of the old chief said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't fire!
          don't fire! I beg of you. In killing the serpent, it is me that you
          would kill. Fear nothing. The serpent is my <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">elangela</span></span>.”</span> So saying he
          flung himself on his knees beside the reptile, put his arms about
          it, and clasped it to his breast. The serpent received his caresses
          quietly, manifesting neither anger nor fear, and the chief carried
          it off and laid it down beside him in another hut, exhorting the
          missionary to have no fear and never to speak of the subject.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> His
          curiosity being excited by this adventure, the missionary, Father
          Trilles, pursued his enquiries and ascertained that among the Fans
          of the Gaboon every wizard is believed at initiation to unite his
          life with that of some particular wild animal by a rite of
          blood-brotherhood; he draws blood from the ear of the animal and
          from his own arm, and inoculates the animal with his own blood, and
          himself with the blood of the beast. Henceforth such an intimate
          union is established between the two that the death of the one
          entails the death of the other. The alliance is thought to bring to
          the wizard or sorcerer a great accession of power, which he can
          turn to his advantage in various ways. In the first place, like the
          warlock in the fairy tales who has deposited his life outside of
          himself in some safe place, the Fan wizard now deems himself
          invulnerable. Moreover, the animal with which he has exchanged
          blood has become his familiar, and will obey any orders he may
          choose to give it; so he makes use of it to injure and kill his
          enemies. For that reason the creature with whom he establishes the
          relation of blood-brotherhood is never a tame or domestic animal,
          but always a ferocious and dangerous wild beast, such as a leopard,
          a black serpent, a crocodile, a hippopotamus, a wild boar, or a
          vulture. Of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg
          202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          all these creatures the leopard is by far the commonest familiar of
          Fan wizards, and next to it comes the black serpent; the vulture is
          the rarest. Witches as well as wizards have their familiars; but
          the animals with which the lives of women are thus bound up
          generally differ from those to which men commit their external
          souls. A witch never has a panther for her familiar, but often a
          venomous species of serpent, sometimes a horned viper, sometimes a
          black serpent, sometimes a green one that lives in banana-trees; or
          it may be a vulture, an owl, or other bird of night. In every case
          the beast or bird with which the witch or wizard has contracted
          this mystic alliance is an individual, never a species; and when
          the individual animal dies the alliance is naturally at an end,
          since the death of the animal is supposed to entail the death of
          the man.<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Similar beliefs
          are held by the natives of the Cross River valley within the German
          provinces of the Cameroons. Groups of people, generally the
          inhabitants of a village, have chosen various animals, with which
          they believe themselves to stand on a footing of intimate
          friendship or relationship. Amongst such animals are
          hippopotamuses, elephants, leopards, crocodiles, gorillas, fish,
          and serpents, all of them creatures which are either very strong or
          can easily hide themselves in the water or a thicket. This power of
          concealing themselves is said to be an indispensable condition of
          the choice of animal familiars, since the animal friend or helper
          is expected to injure his owner's enemy by stealth; for example, if
          he is a hippopotamus, he will bob up suddenly out of the water and
          capsize the enemy's canoe. Between the animals and their human
          friends or kinsfolk such a sympathetic relation is supposed to
          exist that the moment the animal dies the man dies also, and
          similarly the instant the man <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> perishes so does the beast. From this it
          follows that the animal kinsfolk may never be shot at or molested
          for fear of injuring or killing the persons whose lives are knit up
          with the lives of the brutes. This does not, however, prevent the
          people of a village, who have elephants for their animal friends,
          from hunting elephants. For they do not respect the whole species
          but merely certain individuals of it, which stand in an intimate
          relation to certain individual men and women; and they imagine that
          they can always distinguish these brother elephants from the common
          herd of elephants which are mere elephants and nothing more. The
          recognition indeed is said to be mutual. When a hunter, who has an
          elephant for his friend, meets a human elephant, as we may call it,
          the noble animal lifts up a paw and holds it before his face, as
          much as to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't shoot.”</span> Were
          the hunter so inhuman as to fire on and wound such an elephant, the
          person whose life was bound up with the elephant would fall
          ill.<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href=

          man dies; and if the animal be wounded, the man's body will
          presently be covered with boils. This belief instigates to many

          administer the magical drug to his enemy in his food, and having

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The negroes of
          Calabar, at the mouth of the Niger, believe that every person has
          four souls, one of which always lives outside of his or her body in
          the form of a wild beast in the forest. This external soul, or bush
          soul, as Miss Kingsley calls it, may be almost any animal, for
          example, a leopard, a fish, or a tortoise; but it is never a
          domestic animal and never a plant. Unless he is gifted with second
          sight, a man cannot see his own bush soul, but a diviner will often
          tell him what sort of creature his bush soul is, and after that the
          man will be careful not to kill any animal of that species, and
          will strongly object to any one else doing so. A man and his sons
          have usually the same sort of animals for their bush souls, and so
          with a mother and her daughters. But sometimes all the children of
          a family take after the bush soul of their father; for example, if
          his external soul is a leopard, all his sons and daughters will
          have leopards for their external souls. And on the other hand,
          sometimes they all take after their mother; for instance, if her
          external soul is a tortoise, all the external souls of her sons and
          daughters will be tortoises too. So intimately bound up is the life
          of the man with that of the animal which he regards as his external
          or bush soul, that the death or injury of the animal necessarily
          entails the death or injury of the man. <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> And, conversely, when the man dies, his bush
          soul can no longer find a place of rest, but goes mad and rushes
          into the fire or charges people and is knocked on the head, and
          that is an end of it. When a person is sick, the diviner will
          sometimes tell him that his bush soul is angry at being neglected;
          thereupon the patient will make an offering to the offended spirit
          and deposit it in a tiny hut in the forest at the spot where the
          animal, which is his external soul, was last seen. If the bush soul
          is appeased, the patient recovers; but if it is not, he dies. Yet
          the foolish bush soul does not understand that in injuring the man
          it injures itself, and that it cannot long survive his
          decease.<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the
          account which Miss Kingsley gives of the bush souls of the Calabar
          negroes. Some fresh particulars are furnished by Mr. Richard
          Henshaw, Agent for Native Affairs at Calabar. He tells us that a
          man may only marry a woman who has the same sort of bush soul as
          himself; for example, if his bush soul is a leopard, his wife also
          must have a leopard for her bush soul. Further, we learn from Mr.
          Henshaw that a person's bush soul need not be that either of his
          father or of his mother. For example, a child with a hippopotamus
          for his bush soul may be born into a family, all the members of
          which have wild pigs for their bush souls; this happens when the
          child is a reincarnation of a man whose external soul was a
          hippopotamus. In such a case, if the parents object to the
          intrusion of an alien soul, they may call in a medicine-man to
          check its growth and finally abolish it altogether, after which
          they will give the child their own bush soul. Or they may leave the
          matter over till the child comes of age, when he will choose a bush
          soul for himself with the help of a medicine-man, who will also
          select the piece of bush or water in which the chosen animal lives.
          When a man dies, then the animal which contains his <span class=

          approach of danger. Thus a hunter can capture or kill him with
          perfect ease.”</span> Sacrifices are often offered to prevent other
          people from killing the animal in which a man's bush soul resides.
          The tribes of Calabar which hold these beliefs as to the bush soul
          are the Efik and Ekoi.<a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href=

          belief of the Calabar negroes in the external soul has been

          It primarily signifies the shadow of a person. It also signifies
          that which dwells within a man on which his life depends, but which
          may detach itself from the body, and visiting places and persons
          here and there, again return to its abode in the man.... Besides
          all this, the word is used to designate an animal possessed of an
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Ekoi
          of the Oban district, in Southern Nigeria, it is usual to hear a
          person say of another that he or she <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“possesses”</span> such and such an animal, meaning
          that the person has the power to assume the shape of that
          particular creature. It is their belief that by constant practice
          and by virtue of certain hereditary secrets a man can quit his
          human body and put on that of a wild beast. They say that in
          addition to the soul which animates his human body <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> everybody has a bush soul which at
          times he can send forth to animate the body of the creature which
          he <span class="tei tei-q">“possesses.”</span> When he wishes his
          bush soul to go out on its rambles, he drinks a magic potion, the
          secret of which has been handed down from time immemorial, and some
          of which is always kept ready for use in an ancient earthen pot set
          apart for the purpose. No sooner has he drunk the mystic draught
          than his bush soul escapes from him and floats away invisible
          through the town into the forest. There it begins to swell and,
          safe in the shadow of the trees, takes on the shape of the man's
          animal double, it may be an elephant, a leopard, a buffalo, a wild
          boar, or a crocodile. Naturally the potion differs according to the
          kind of animal into which a man is temporarily converted. It would
          be absurd, for example, to expect that the dose which turns you
          into an elephant should also be able to turn you into a crocodile;
          the thing is manifestly impossible. A great advantage of these
          temporary conversions of a man into a beast is that it enables the
          convert in his animal shape to pay out his enemy without being
          suspected. If, for example, you have a grudge at a man who is a
          well-to-do farmer, all that you have to do is to turn yourself by
          night into a buffalo, an elephant, or a wild boar, and then,
          bursting into his fields, stamp about in them till you have laid
          the standing crops level with the ground. That is why in the
          neighbourhood of large well-tilled farms, people prefer to keep
          their bush souls in buffaloes, elephants, and wild boars, because
          these animals are the most convenient means of destroying a
          neighbour's crops. Whereas where the farms are small and ill-kept,
          as they are round about Oban, it is hardly worth a man's while to
          take the trouble of turning into a buffalo or an elephant for the
          paltry satisfaction of rooting up a few miserable yams or such like
          trash. So the Oban people keep their bush souls in leopards and
          crocodiles, which, though of little use for the purpose of
          destroying a neighbour's crops, are excellent for the purpose of
          killing the man himself first and eating him afterwards. But the
          power of turning into an animal has this serious disadvantage that
          it lays you open to the chance of being wounded or even slain in
          your animal skin before you have time to put it off and scramble
          back into your human integument. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> A remarkable case of this sort happened only
          a few miles from Oban not long ago. To understand it you must know
          that the chiefs of the Ododop tribe, who live about ten miles from
          Oban, keep their bush souls, whenever they are out on a ramble, in
          the shape of buffaloes. Well, one day the District Commissioner at
          Oban saw a buffalo come down to drink at a stream which runs
          through his garden. He shot at the beast and hit it, and it ran
          away badly wounded. At the very same moment the head chief of the
          Ododop tribe, ten miles away, clapped his hand to his side and
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“They have killed me at Oban.”</span>
          Death was not instantaneous, for the buffalo lingered in pain for a
          couple of days in the forest, but an hour or two before its dead
          body was discovered by the trackers the chief expired. Just before
          he died, with touching solicitude he sent a message warning all
          people who kept their external souls in buffaloes to profit by his
          sad fate and beware of going near Oban, which was not a safe place
          for them. Naturally, when a man keeps his external soul from time
          to time in a beast, say in a wild cow, he is not so foolish as to
          shoot an animal of that particular sort, for in so doing he might
          perhaps be killing himself. But he may kill animals in which other
          people keep their external souls. For example, a wild cow man may
          freely shoot an antelope or a wild boar; but should he do so and
          then have reason to suspect that the dead beast is the animal
          double of somebody with whom he is on friendly terms, he must
          perform certain ceremonies over the carcase and then hurry home,
          running at the top of his speed, to administer a particular
          medicine to the man whom he has unintentionally injured. In this
          way he may possibly be in time to save the life of his friend from
          the effects of the deplorable accident.<a id="noteref_561" name=

          used from time to time to hunt the animal, and once a peculiarly
          energetic officer contrived to hit it. Forthwith the chief was laid
          up with a wound in his leg. He gave out that a dog had bitten him,
          but no doubt the wise shook their heads and refused to be put off

          a hippopotamus. It is believed that such a person's life is bound
          up with that of the animal to such an extent that, whatever affects
          the one produces a corresponding impression upon the other, and
          that if one dies the other must speedily do so too. It happened not
          very long ago that an Englishman shot a hippopotamus close to a
          native village; the friends of a woman who died the same night in
          the village demanded and eventually obtained five pounds as

          of the compounds there will be found a species of snake, of a
          non-poisonous sort, which, when full grown, attains a length of
          about five feet and a girth of eight or nine inches. These snakes
          live in and about the compound. They are not specially fed by the
          people of the place, nor are places provided for them to nest in.
          They live generally in the roofs of the small granaries and huts
          that make up the compound. They feed upon small mammals, and no
          doubt serve a useful purpose in destroying vermin which might
          otherwise eat the stored grain. They are not kept for the purpose
          of destroying vermin, however. The Montols believe that at the
          birth of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg

          every individual of their race, male and female, one of these
          snakes, of the same sex, is also born. If the snake be killed, his
          human partner in life dies also and at the same time. If the wife
          of a compound-owner gives birth to a son, shortly after the
          interesting event, the snake of the establishment will be seen with
          a young one of corresponding sex. From the moment of birth, these
          two, the snake and the man, share a life of common duration, and
          the measure of the one is the measure of the other. Hence every
          care is taken to protect these animals from injury, and no Montol
          would in any circumstances think of injuring or killing one. It is
          said that a snake of this kind never attempts any injury to a man.

          does not appear whether the sympathetic relation between a man and
          a crocodile is supposed by the Bechuanas to be lifelong, or only to
          arise at the moment when the man wounds the animal; in the latter
          case the shedding of the crocodile's blood might perhaps be thought
          to establish a relationship of affinity or sympathy between the

          Herrera's account of the way in which the Indians of Honduras
          acquired their <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "tei tei-q">“The devil deluded them, appearing in the shape of a
          lion or a tiger, or a coyte, a beast like a wolf, or in the shape
          of an alligator, a snake, or a bird, that province abounding in
          creatures of prey, which they called <span class=

          "font-style: italic">naguales</span></span>, signifying keepers or
          guardians, and when the bird died the Indian that was in league
          with him died also, which often happened and was looked upon as
          infallible. The manner of contracting this alliance was thus. The
          Indian repaired to the river, wood, hill, or most obscure
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name=
          "Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> place, where he
          called upon the devils by such names as he thought fit, talked to
          the rivers, rocks, or woods, said he went to weep that he might
          have the same his predecessors had, carrying a cock or a dog to
          sacrifice. In that melancholy fit he fell asleep, and either in a
          dream or waking saw some one of the aforesaid birds or other
          creatures, whom he entreated to grant him profit in salt, cacao, or
          any other commodity, drawing blood from his own tongue, ears, and
          other parts of his body, making his contract at the same time with
          the said creature, the which either in a dream or waking told him,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Such a day you shall go abroad asporting,

          them, that when one of them died the other did not survive, and
          they fancied that he who had no <span class=

          Legend affirms that in the first battles with the Spaniards on the

          especially conspicuous, because it had the form of a great bird,
          resplendent in green plumage. The Spanish general Pedro de Alvarado
          killed the bird with his lance, and at the same moment the Indian
          chief fell dead to the ground.<a id="noteref_574" name=

          his life was bound up, the Australians only knew that each of their
          lives was bound up with some one animal of the species, but they
          could not say with which. The result naturally was that every man
          spared and protected all the animals of the species with which the
          lives of the men were bound up; and every woman spared and
          protected all the animals of the species with which the lives of

          any animal of the respective species might entail his or her own;
          just as the killing of the green bird was immediately followed by
          the death of the Indian chief, and the killing of the parrot by the
          death of Punchkin in the fairy tale. Thus, for example, the
          Wotjobaluk tribe of South-Eastern Australia <span class=

          when either of these creatures is killed the life of some man or of
          some woman is shortened. In such a case every man or every woman in
          the camp feared that he or she might be the victim, and from this
          cause great fights arose in this tribe. I learn that in these
          fights, men on one side and women on the other, it was not at all
          certain which would be victorious, for at times the women gave the
          men a severe drubbing with their yamsticks, while often women were
          injured or killed by spears.”</span> The Wotjobaluk said that the
          bat was the man's <span class="tei tei-q">“brother”</span> and that
          the nightjar was his <span class="tei tei-q">“wife.”</span><a id=

          notable that in South-Eastern Australia the animals thus associated

          whatever the particular sorts of creature with which the lives of
          men and women were believed to be bound up, the belief itself and
          the fights to which it gave rise are known to have prevailed over a
          large part of South-Eastern Australia, and probably they extended
          much farther.<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href=

          belief was a very serious one, and so consequently were the fights

          <span class="tei tei-q">“the common bat belongs to the men, who
          protect it against injury, even to the half-killing of their wives
          for its sake. The fern owl, or large goatsucker, belongs to the
          women, and, although a bird of evil omen, creating terror at night
          by its cry, it is jealously protected by them. If a man kills one,
          they are as much enraged as if it was one of their children, and
          will strike him with their long poles.”</span><a id="noteref_582"

          not based upon purely selfish considerations. For each man believes
          that not only his own life but the lives of his father, brothers,
          sons, and so on are bound up with the lives of particular bats, and
          that therefore in protecting the bat species he is protecting the
          lives of all his male relations as well as his own. Similarly, each
          woman believes that the lives of her mother, sisters, daughters,
          and so forth, equally with her own, are bound up with the lives of
          particular owls, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg
          218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and that in guarding the owl species she is guarding the lives of
          all her female relations besides her own. Now, when men's lives are
          thus supposed to be contained in certain animals, it is obvious
          that the animals can hardly be distinguished from the men, or the
          men from the animals. If my brother John's life is in a bat, then,
          on the one hand, the bat is my brother as well as John; and, on the
          other hand, John is in a sense a bat, since his life is in a bat.
          Similarly, if my sister Mary's life is in an owl, then the owl is
          my sister and Mary is an owl. This is a natural enough conclusion,
          and the Australians have not failed to draw it. When the bat is the
          man's animal, it is called his brother; and when the owl is the
          woman's animal, it is called her sister. And conversely a man
          addresses a woman as an owl, and she addresses him as a bat.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when a

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it his brother, and refuses to kill it,
          the animal is said to be his totem. Accordingly in the tribes of
          South-Eastern Australia which we have been considering the bat and
          the owl, the emu-wren and the superb warbler, may properly be
          described as totems of the sexes. But the assignation of a totem to
          a sex is comparatively rare, and has hitherto been discovered
          nowhere but in Australia. Far more commonly the totem is
          appropriated not to a sex, but to a clan, and is hereditary either
          in the male or female line. The relation of an individual to the
          clan totem does not differ in kind from his relation to the sex
          totem; he will not kill it, he speaks of it as his brother, and he
          calls himself by its name. Now if the relations are similar, the
          explanation which holds good of the one ought equally to hold good
          of the other. Therefore the reason why a clan revere a particular
          species of animals or plants (for the clan totem may be a plant)
          and call themselves after it, would seem to be a belief that the
          life of each individual of the clan is bound up with some one
          animal or plant of the species, and that his or her death would be
          the consequence of killing that particular animal, or destroying
          that particular plant. This explanation of totemism squares very
          well with Sir George Grey's definition of a totem or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kobong</span></span> in Western Australia. He
          says: <span class="tei tei-q">“A certain mysterious connection
          exists between a family and its <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kobong</span></span>, so that a member of the
          family will never kill an animal of the species to which his
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kobong</span></span> belongs, should he find
          it asleep; indeed he always kills it reluctantly, and never without
          affording it a chance to escape. This arises from the family belief
          that some one individual of the species is their nearest friend, to
          kill whom would be a great crime, and to be carefully avoided.
          Similarly, a native who has a vegetable for his <span class=

          it will be observed that though each man spares all the animals or
          plants of the species, they are not all equally precious to him;
          far from it, out of the whole species there is only one which is
          specially dear to him; but as he does not know which the dear one
          is, he is obliged to spare them all from fear of injuring the one.
          Again, this explanation of the clan totem harmonizes with the
          supposed effect of killing one of the totem species. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“One day one of the blacks killed a crow. Three or four

          the killing of the crow caused the death of a man of the Crow clan,
          exactly as, in the case of the sex-totems, the killing of a bat
          causes the death of a Bat-man or the killing of an owl causes the
          death of an Owl-woman. Similarly, the killing of his <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
          that the story of <span class="tei tei-q">“The giant who had no
          heart in his body”</span> may perhaps furnish the key to the
          relation which is supposed to subsist between a man and his totem.
          The totem, on this theory, is simply the receptacle in which a man
          keeps his life, as Punchkin kept his life in a parrot, and Bidasari
          kept her soul in a golden fish. It is no valid objection to this
          view that when a savage has both a sex totem and a clan totem his
          life must be bound up with two different animals, the death of
          either of which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg
          221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          would entail his own. If a man has more vital places than one in
          his body, why, the savage may think, should he not have more vital
          places than one outside it? Why, since he can put his life outside
          himself, should he not transfer one portion of it to one animal and
          another to another? The divisibility of life, or, to put it
          otherwise, the plurality of souls, is an idea suggested by many
          familiar facts, and has commended itself to philosophers like
          Plato,<a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href=
          "#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a> as
          well as to savages. It finds favour also with the sages of China,
          who tell us that every human being is provided with what may be
          called a male soul (<span lang="zh" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="zh"><span style="font-style: italic">shen</span></span>)
          and a female soul (<span lang="zh" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="zh"><span style="font-style: italic">kwei</span></span>),
          which by their harmonious co-operation compose an organic unity.
          However, some Chinese philosophers will have it that each of the
          five viscera has its own separate male soul (<span lang="zh" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="zh"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">shen</span></span>); and a Taoist treatise
          written about the end of the tenth or beginning of the eleventh
          century has even enriched science with a list of about three dozen
          souls distributed over the various parts of the human frame;
          indeed, not content with a bare catalogue of these souls, the
          learned author has annexed to the name and surname of each a brief
          description of its size and stature, of the kind of dress in which
          it is clothed and the shape of hat it wears.<a id="noteref_590"
          name="noteref_590" href="#note_590"><span class=

          only when the notion of a soul, from being a quasi-scientific
          hypothesis, becomes a theological dogma that its unity and
          indivisibility are insisted upon as essential. The savage,
          unshackled by dogma, is free to explain the facts of life by the
          assumption of as many souls as he thinks necessary. Hence, for
          example, the Caribs supposed that there was one soul in the head,
          another in the heart, and other souls at all the places where an
          artery is felt pulsating.<a id="noteref_591" name="noteref_591"

          Hence, from the primitive point of view, it is perfectly possible
          that a savage should have one soul in his sex totem and another in
          his clan totem. However, as I have observed, sex totems have been
          found nowhere but in Australia; so that as a rule the savage who
          practises totemism need not have more than one soul out of his body
          at a time.<a id="noteref_596" name="noteref_596" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this
          explanation of the totem as a receptacle in which a man keeps his
          soul or one of his souls is correct, we should expect to find some
          totemic people of whom it is expressly said that every man amongst
          them is believed to keep at least one soul permanently out of his
          body, and that the destruction of this external soul is supposed to
          entail the death of its owner. Such a people are the Battas of
          Sumatra. The Battas are divided into exogamous clans (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">margas</span></span>) with descent in the male

          may not eat the tiger, another the ape, another the crocodile,
          another the dog, another the cat, another the dove, another the
          white buffalo, and another the locust. The reason given by members
          of a clan for abstaining from the flesh of the particular animal is
          either that they are descended from animals of that species, and
          that their souls after death may transmigrate into the animals, or
          that they or their forefathers have been under certain obligations
          to the creatures. Sometimes, but not always, the clan bears the

          the Battas have totemism in full. But, further, each Batta believes
          that he has seven or, on a more moderate computation, three souls.
          One of these souls is always outside the body, but nevertheless
          whenever it dies, however far away it may be at the time, that same

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> about the Batta totems; but on the
          analogy of the Australian, Central American, and African evidence
          we may conjecture that the external soul, whose death entails the
          death of the man, is housed in the totemic animal or plant.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Against this
          view it can hardly be thought to militate that the Batta does not
          in set terms affirm his external soul to be in his totem, but
          alleges other grounds for respecting the sacred animal or plant of
          his clan. For if a savage seriously believes that his life is bound
          up with an external object, it is in the last degree unlikely that
          he will let any stranger into the secret. In all that touches his
          inmost life and beliefs the savage is exceedingly suspicious and
          reserved; Europeans have resided among savages for years without
          discovering some of their capital articles of faith, and in the end
          the discovery has often been the result of accident.<a id=

          all, the savage lives in an intense and perpetual dread of
          assassination by sorcery; the most trifling relics of his

          remnants of his food, his very name<a id="noteref_600" name=

          therefore anxiously careful to conceal or destroy them. But if in
          matters such as these, which are but the outposts and outworks of
          his life, he is so shy and secretive, how close must be the
          concealment, how impenetrable the reserve in which he enshrouds the
          inner keep and citadel of his being! When the princess in the fairy
          tale asks the giant where he keeps his soul, he often gives false
          or evasive answers, and it is only after much coaxing and wheedling
          that the secret is at last wrung from him. In his jealous reticence
          the giant resembles the timid and furtive savage; but whereas the
          exigencies of the story demand that the giant should at last reveal
          his secret, no such obligation is laid on the savage; and no
          inducement that can be offered is likely to tempt him to imperil
          his soul by revealing its hiding-place to a stranger. It is
          therefore no matter for surprise that the central mystery of the
          savage's life should so long have remained a secret, and that we
          should be left to piece it together from scattered hints and
          fragments and from the recollections of it which linger in fairy
          tales.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This view of
          totemism throws light on a class of religious rites of which no
          adequate explanation, so far as I am aware, has yet been offered.
          Amongst many savage tribes, especially such as are known to
          practise totemism, it is customary for lads at puberty to undergo
          certain initiatory rites, of which one of the commonest is a
          pretence of killing the lad and bringing him to life again. Such
          rites become intelligible if we suppose that their substance
          consists in extracting the youth's soul in order to transfer it to
          his totem. For the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg
          226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          extraction of his soul would naturally be supposed to kill the
          youth or at least to throw him into a death-like trance, which the
          savage hardly distinguishes from death. His recovery would then be
          attributed either to the gradual recovery of his system from the
          violent shock which it had received, or, more probably, to the
          infusion into him of fresh life drawn from the totem. Thus the
          essence of these initiatory rites, so far as they consist in a
          simulation of death and resurrection, would be an exchange of life
          or souls between the man and his totem. The primitive belief in the
          possibility of such an exchange of souls comes clearly out in the
          story of the Basque hunter who affirmed that he had been killed by
          a bear, but that the bear had, after killing him, breathed its own
          soul into him, so that the bear's body was now dead, but he himself
          was a bear, being animated by the bear's soul.<a id="noteref_601"
          name="noteref_601" href="#note_601"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">601</span></span></a> This
          revival of the dead hunter as a bear is exactly analogous to what,
          on the theory here suggested, is supposed to take place in the
          ceremony of killing a lad at puberty and bringing him to life
          again. The lad dies as a man and comes to life again as an animal;
          the animal's soul is now in him, and his human soul is in the
          animal. With good right, therefore, does he call himself a Bear or
          a Wolf, etc., according to his totem; and with good right does he
          treat the bears or the wolves, etc., as his brethren, since in
          these animals are lodged the souls of himself and his kindred.</p>

          loud humming noise is heard, which is made with an instrument of
          the following description: a flat piece of wood is made with
          serrated edges, and having a hole at one end, to which a string is
          attached, and this swung round produces a humming noise. The
          uninitiated are not even allowed to see this instrument. Women are
          forbidden to be present at these ceremonies, and should one, by
          accident or otherwise, witness them, the penalty is death. The
          penalty for revealing the secrets is probably the same. When
          everything is prepared the women and children are covered with
          boughs, and the men retire, with the young fellows who are to be
          initiated, to a little distance. It is said that the youths are
          sent away a short distance one by one, and that they are each met
          in turn by a Being, who, so far as I can understand, is believed to
          be something between a blackfellow and a spirit. This Being, called
          Thuremlin, it is said, takes the youth to a distance, kills him,
          and in some instances cuts him up, after which he restores him to
          life and knocks out a tooth. Their belief in the power of Thuremlin
          is undoubted.”</span><a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href=

          uninitiated lads, who are taught to believe that its sonorous and
          long-drawn notes are the voice of the mythical being, often called
          Daramulun, who lives in the sky, instituted the rites, and
          superintends their performance. The hollow roar of the slat of
          wood, as it is swung round and round, <span class=

          passed through an initiatory rite, which consisted in cutting a row
          of gashes in his back, he was given a bull-roarer, and when he went
          out in search of game, he used to twirl the implement in the belief
          that by doing so, while his wounds were still unhealed, he created
          a good harvest of snakes, lizards, and other reptiles, which the
          natives employ as food; but on the contrary they imagined that
          these supplies of food would be cut off for ever, if a woman were

          the fall of rain is regularly followed by a great and sudden
          increase in the food supply, and that this increase is most marked
          after violent thunder-storms. Hence by making a noise like thunder
          with the help of bull-roarers they probably hope, on the principle
          of imitative magic, to bring on a thunder-storm and with it a

          Hence, as an instrument whose sound resembles the rumbling of
          thunder, the roar of wind, and the patter of rain, the bull-roarer
          is naturally swung by agricultural savages as a powerful means of
          promoting the growth of the crops. In the island of Kiwai, off the
          mouth of the Fly River in British New Guinea, bull-roarers are
          whirled in order to ensure a good crop of yams, sweet potatoes, and

          Perhaps the reason may be that the blood dripping from the gashes
          is thought to resemble rain and therefore to be endowed with a
          magical potency of drawing showers from the clouds. The conjecture
          is confirmed by the observation that the Dieri actually do bleed
          themselves avowedly for the purpose of making rain, and they are
          not the only people in Australia and elsewhere who have resorted to

          Altogether the foregoing evidence seems to hint that the whole

          comes out when a youth is initiated. They think that the spirit
          enters the body of the lad after the operation of circumcision has
          been performed and carries him away into the bush, keeping him
          there till his wound is healed. While the newly circumcised youth
          is out in the wilds, carefully secluded from the sight of the women
          and children, he constantly sounds the bull-roarer. When he has
          recovered from the wound, the spirit leaves him and he returns to
          camp an initiated, or rather partially initiated, man. He has
          learned, at all events, the secret of Twanyirika; for no sooner is

          bull-roarer at initiation is made by a spirit named Katajalina, who
          lives in an ant-hill and comes <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class=

          him to life.<a id="noteref_622" name="noteref_622" href=

          Similarly among their neighbours the Anula the women imagine that
          the droning sound of the bull-roarer is produced by a spirit called
          Gnabaia, who swallows the lads at initiation and afterwards
          disgorges them in the form of initiated men. In this tribe, after a
          lad has been subincised as well as circumcised, he is presented
          with a bull-roarer and informed that the instrument was originally
          made by the whirlwind, that it is sacred or tabooed, and that it
          may on no account be shewn to women or children.<a id="noteref_623"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the tribes
          settled on the southern coast of New South Wales, of which the
          Coast Murring tribe may be regarded as typical, the drama of
          resurrection from the dead was exhibited in a graphic form to the
          novices at initiation. Before they were privileged to witness this
          edifying spectacle they had been raised to the dignity of manhood
          by an old man, who promoted them to their new status by the simple
          process of knocking a tooth out of the mouth of each with the help
          of a wooden chisel and hammer. The ceremony of the resurrection has
          been described for us in detail by an eye-witness, the late Dr. A.
          W. Howitt, one of the best authorities on the customs of the
          Australian aborigines. The scene selected for the sacred drama was
          the bottom of a deep valley, where a sluggish stream wound through
          a bed of tall sharp-edged sedge. Though the hour was between ten
          and eleven o'clock in the morning, the sun had but just peeped over
          the mountains which enclosed the valley like a wall on the east;
          and while the upper slopes, clothed with a forest of tall rowan
          trees, looked warm and bright in sunshine, which shot between the
          grey stems and under the light feathery foliage of the trees, all
          the bottom of the dell was still in deep shadow and dank with the
          moisture of the night's rain. While the novices rested and warmed
          themselves at a crackling fire, the initiated men laid their heads
          together, prepared a stock of decorations made of stringy bark, and
          dug a grave. There was some discussion as to the shape of the
          grave, but the man who was to be buried in it decided the question
          by declaring that he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg
          236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          would be laid in it on his back at full length. He was a man of the
          eagle-hawk totem and belonged to the tribal subdivision called
          Yibai. So while two men under his directions were digging the grave
          with sticks in the friable granitic soil, he superintended the
          costume of the other actors in the drama. Sheets of bark were
          beaten out into fleeces of stringy fibre, and in these garments six
          performers were clothed from head to foot so that not even a
          glimpse could be obtained of their faces. Four of them were tied
          together by a cord which was fastened to the back of their heads,
          and each of them carried two pieces of bark in his hands. The other
          two walked free, but hobbled along bent double and supporting their
          tottery steps on staves to mark the weight of years; for they
          played the part of two medicine-men of venerable age and great
          magical power. By this time the grave was ready, and the eagle-hawk
          man stretched himself in it at full length on a bed of leaves, his
          head resting on a rolled-up blanket, just as if he were a corpse.
          In his two hands, crossed on his chest, he held the stem of a young
          tree (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Persoonia
          linearis</span></span>), which had been pulled up by the roots and
          now stood planted on his chest, so that the top of it rose several
          feet above the level of the ground. A light covering of dried
          sticks filled the grave, and dead leaves, tufts of grass, and small
          plants were artistically arranged over them so as to complete the
          illusion. All being now ready, the novices were led by their
          sisters' husbands to the grave and placed in a row beside it, while
          a singer, perched on the trunk of a fallen tree at the head of the
          grave, crooned a melancholy ditty, the song of Yibai. Though the
          words of the song consisted merely of a monotonous repetition of
          the words <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Burrin-burrin Yibai</span></span>, that is,
          Stringy-bark Yibai, they were understood to refer to the eagle-hawk
          totem, as well as to the tribal subdivision of the buried man. Then
          to the slow, plaintive but well-marked air of the song the actors
          began to move forward, winding among the trees, logs, and rocks. On
          came the four disguised men, stepping in time to the music, swaying
          from side to side, and clashing their bark clappers together at
          every step, while beside them hobbled the two old men keeping a
          little aloof to mark their superior dignity. They represented a
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name=
          "Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> party of
          medicine-men, guided by two reverend seniors, who had come on
          pilgrimage to the grave of a brother medicine-man, him of the
          eagle-hawk totem, who lay buried here in the lonely valley, now
          illumined by the warm rays of the sun; for by this time the morning
          was wearing on to noon. When the little procession, chanting an
          invocation to Daramulun, had defiled from among the rocks and trees
          into the open, it drew up on the side of the grave opposite to the
          novices, the two old men taking up a position in the rear of the
          dancers. For some time the dance and song went on till the tree
          that seemed to grow from the grave began to quiver. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Look there!”</span> cried the sisters' husbands to the
          novices, pointing to the trembling leaves. As they looked, the tree
          quivered more and more, then was violently agitated and fell to the
          ground, while amid the excited dancing of the dancers and the
          chanting of the tuneful choir the supposed dead man spurned from
          him the superincumbent mass of sticks and leaves, and springing to
          his feet danced his magic dance in the grave itself, and exhibited
          in his mouth the magic substances which he was supposed to have
          received from Daramulun in person.<a id="noteref_624" name=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some tribes
          of Central and Northern Australia the initiation of a medicine-man
          into the mysteries of his craft is supposed to be accomplished by
          certain spirits, who kill him, cut out his internal organs, and
          having provided him with a new set bring him to life again.
          Sometimes the spirits kindly replace the man's human organs by
          their own spiritual organs; sometimes along with the new organs
          they insert magical stones in his body or even a serpent, and the
          stones or the serpents naturally endow the new wizards with
          marvellous powers. In some tribes the initiation takes place in a
          cave, where the spirits dwell. After the man has been restored to
          life with a new heart, a new pair of lungs, and so forth, he
          returns to his people in a more or less dazed condition, which his
          friends may at first mistake for insanity, though afterwards they
          recognize <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg

          had completely forgotten who he was and all about his past life.
          After a time his venerable friend led him back to the camp and
          shewed it to him, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“That woman
          there is your wife,”</span> for she had gone clean out of his

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">626</span></span></a> We
          shall see presently that this temporary oblivion, a natural effect
          of the shock to the nervous system produced by resuscitation from
          the dead, is characteristic of novices under similar circumstances
          in other lands. Among the Arunta of Alice Springs the cave where
          the mystic initiation takes place is a limestone cavern in a range
          of hills which rises to the north of the wide level expanse known
          as the Emily plain. None of the ordinary natives would dare to set
          foot in the awful grotto, which they believe to extend for miles
          into the bowels of the earth and to be tenanted by certain
          ancestral spirits, who live there in perpetual sunshine and amid
          streams of running water, an earthly paradise by contrast with the
          arid sun-scorched steppes and barren mountains outside. White men
          have explored the cave, and if they perceived no spirits, they
          found bats in plenty. The man who aspires to the rank of a wizard
          lies down at the mouth of the cave and falls asleep; and as he
          sleeps one of the ancestral spirits steals up to him and drives an
          invisible spear through his neck from back to front. The point of
          the spear comes out through the man's tongue, leaving a hole
          through which you could put your little finger, and this hole the
          man retains for the rest of his natural life, or at least so long
          as he retains his magical powers; for if the hole should close up,
          these spiritual gifts and graces would depart from him. A second
          thrust from the invisible spear transfixes the man's head from ear
          to ear; he drops down dead, and is immediately transported into the
          depths of the cavern, where the spirits dissect his dead body,
          extract the old viscera, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          of the manner in which medicine-men obtain their magical powers not
          only are the supposed death and resurrection of the novice worthy
          of attention, but also the exchange of internal organs which in the
          Binbinga and Mara tribes is supposed to be effected between the man

          this exchange resembles that which, on the theory I have suggested,
          may be thought to take place between a lad and his totem at the
          ceremonies of initiation which mark the momentous transition from
          boyhood to manhood. Further, the bodily mutilation which is the
          visible sign of the medicine-man's initiation (for however the hole
          may be made it certainly exists in the tongues of regular Arunta
          practitioners) corresponds to the bodily mutilations of other
          sorts, which in many savage tribes attest to the world that the
          mutilated persons are fullgrown men. What the precise meaning of
          such mutilations may be, still remains very obscure; but they seem
          in some cases to be directly associated with the conception of
          death and resurrection.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This association
          certainly comes out plainly in the rites of initiation through
          which in some parts of New Guinea all lads must pass before they
          attain to the status of adults. The rites are observed by a group
          of tribes who occupy contiguous territories about Finsch Harbour
          and Huon Gulf in German New Guinea. The tribes in question are the
          Yabim, the Bukaua, the Kai, and the Tami. All of them except the
          Kai belong to the Melanesian stock and are therefore presumably
          immigrants from the adjoining islands; but the Kai, who inhabit the
          rugged, densely wooded, and rainy mountains inland from Finsch
          Harbour, belong to the aboriginal Papuan stock and differ from
          their neighbours in speech as well as in appearance. Yet the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name=
          "Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> rites of initiation
          which all these tribes celebrate and the beliefs which they
          associate with them are so similar that a single description will
          apply accurately enough to them all. All of them, like many
          Australian tribes, require every male member of the tribe to be
          circumcised before he ranks as a full-grown man; and the tribal
          initiation, of which circumcision is the central feature, is
          conceived by them, as by some Australian tribes, as a process of
          being swallowed and disgorged by a mythical monster, whose voice is
          heard in the humming sound of the bull-roarer. Indeed the New
          Guinea tribes not only impress this belief on the minds of women
          and children, but enact it in a dramatic form at the actual rites
          of initiation, at which no woman or uninitiated person may be
          present. For this purpose a hut about a hundred feet long is
          erected either in the village or in a lonely part of the forest. It
          is modelled in the shape of the mythical monster; at the end which
          represents his head it is high, and it tapers away at the other
          end. A betel-palm, grubbed up with the roots, stands for the
          backbone of the great being and its clustering fibres for his hair;
          and to complete the resemblance the butt end of the building is
          adorned by a native artist with a pair of goggle eyes and a gaping
          mouth. When after a tearful parting from their mothers and women
          folk, who believe or pretend to believe in the monster that
          swallows their dear ones, the awe-struck novices are brought face
          to face with this imposing structure, the huge creature emits a
          sullen growl, which is in fact no other than the humming note of
          bull-roarers swung by men concealed in the monster's belly. The
          actual process of deglutition is variously enacted. Among the Tami
          it is represented by causing the candidates to defile past a row of
          men who hold bull-roarers over their heads; among the Kai it is
          more graphically set forth by making them pass under a scaffold on
          which stands a man, who makes a gesture of swallowing and takes in
          fact a gulp of water as each trembling novice passes beneath him.
          But the present of a pig, opportunely offered for the redemption of
          the youth, induces the monster to relent and disgorge his victim;
          the man who represents the monster accepts the gift vicariously, a
          gurgling sound is heard, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the water which had just been swallowed
          descends in a jet on the novice. This signifies that the young man
          has been released from the monster's belly. However, he has now to
          undergo the more painful and dangerous operation of circumcision.
          It follows immediately, and the cut made by the knife of the
          operator is explained to be a bite or scratch which the monster
          inflicted on the novice in spewing him out of his capacious maw.
          While the operation is proceeding, a prodigious noise is made by
          the swinging of bull-roarers to represent the roar of the dreadful
          being who is in the act of swallowing the young men.</p>

          and that unfortunately her son slipped into the wrong stomach, from
          which it was impossible to extricate him. After they have been
          circumcised the lads must remain for some months in seclusion,
          shunning all contact with women and even the sight of them. They
          live in the long hut which represents the monster's belly; among
          the Yabim they beguile the tedium of this enforced leisure by
          weaving baskets and playing on certain sacred flutes, which are
          never used except on these occasions. The instruments are of two
          patterns. One is called the male and the other the female; and they
          are believed to be married to each other. No woman may see these
          mysterious flutes; if she did, she would die. When the long
          seclusion is over, the lads, now ranking as initiated men, are
          brought back with great pomp and ceremony to the village, where
          they are received with sobs and tears of joy by the women, as if
          the grave had given up its dead. At first the young men keep their
          eyes rigidly closed or even sealed with a plaster of chalk, and
          they appear not to understand the words of command which are given
          them by an elder. Gradually, however, they come to themselves as if
          awaking from a stupor, and next day they bathe and wash off the
          crust of white chalk with which their bodies had been coated.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is highly
          significant that all these tribes of New Guinea apply the same word
          to the bull-roarer and to the monster, who is supposed to swallow
          the novices at circumcision, and whose fearful roar is represented
          by the hum of the harmless wooden instruments. The word in the
          speech of the Yabim and Bukaua is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">balum</span></span>; in that of the Kai it is

          it is <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kani</span></span>. Further, it deserves to be
          noted that in three languages out of the four the same word which
          is applied to the bull-roarer and to the monster means also a ghost
          or spirit of the dead, while in the fourth language (the Kai) it
          signifies <span class="tei tei-q">“grandfather.”</span> From this
          it seems to follow that the being who swallows and disgorges the
          novices at initiation is believed to be a powerful ghost or
          ancestral spirit, and that the bull-roarer, which bears his name,
          is his material representative. That would explain the jealous
          secrecy with which the sacred implement is kept from the sight of
          women. While they are not in use, the bull-roarers are stowed away
          in the men's club-houses, which no woman may enter; indeed no woman
          or uninitiated person may set eyes on a bull-roarer under pain of
          death.<a id="noteref_630" name="noteref_630" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In certain
          districts of Viti Levu, the largest of the Fijian Islands, the
          drama of death and resurrection used to be acted with much
          solemnity before the eyes of young men at initiation. The
          ceremonies were performed in certain sacred precincts of oblong
          shape, enclosed by low walls or rows of stones but open to the sky.
          Such a precinct was called a <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nanga</span></span>, and it might be described
          as a temple dedicated to the worship of ancestors; for in it
          sacrifices and prayers were offered to the ancestral spirits. For
          example, the first-fruits of the yam harvest were regularly
          presented with great ceremony to the souls of the dead in the
          temple before the bulk of the crop was dug for the people's use,
          and no man might taste of the new yams until this solemn offering
          had been made. The yams so offered were piled up in the sacred
          enclosure and left to rot there; if any man were so bold as to eat
          of these dedicated fruits, it was believed that he would go
          mad.<a id="noteref_632" name="noteref_632" href=

          initiated man had the right of approaching the ancestral spirits at
          any time in their holy place, where he would pray to them for help
          and protection and propitiate them by laying down his offering of a
          pig, or yams, or eels, or cloth, or what not.<a id="noteref_633"

          these offerings perhaps the most curious was that of the foreskins

          or atonement for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg

          the recovery of a sick relative, it might be either their father or
          one of their father's brothers. The bloody foreskins, stuck in the
          cleft of a split reed, were presented to the ancestral gods in the
          temple by the chief priest, who prayed for the sick man's
          recovery.<a id="noteref_634" name="noteref_634" href=

          beginning of November, which was the commencement of the Fijian New

          coincided with the New Year of the Tahitians and Hawaiians, who
          dated the commencement of the year by observation of the Pleiades.
          The highlanders of Fiji, who alone celebrated these rites, did not

          for the solemnity the heads of the novices were shaved and their
          beards, if they had any, were carefully eradicated. On four
          successive days they went in procession to the temple and there
          deposited in the Holy of Holies their offerings of cloth and
          weapons to the ancestral spirits. But on the fifth and great day of
          the festival, when they again entered the sacred ground, they
          beheld a sight which froze their souls with horror. Stretched on
          the ground was a row of dead or seemingly dead and murdered men,
          their bodies cut open and covered with blood, their entrails
          protruding. At the further end sat the High Priest, regarding them
          with a stony glare, and to reach him the trembling novices had to
          crawl on hands and knees over the ghastly blood-bedabbled corpses
          that lay between. Having done so they drew up in a line before him.
          Suddenly he blurted out a piercing yell, at which the counterfeit
          dead men started to their feet and ran down to the river to cleanse
          themselves from the blood and guts of pigs with which they were
          beslobbered. The High Priest now unbent his starched dignity, and
          skipping from side to side cried in stridulous tones, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Where are the people of my enclosure? Are they gone to
          Tonga Levu? Are they gone to the deep sea?”</span> He was soon
          answered by a deep-mouthed chant, and back from the river marched
          the dead men come to life, clean, fresh, and garlanded, swaying
          their bodies in time to the music of their solemn hymn. They took
          their places in front of the novices and a religious silence
          ensued. Such was the drama of death and resurrection. It was
          immediately followed by a sacramental meal. Four old men of the
          highest order of initiates now entered the Holy of Holies. The
          first bore a cooked yam carefully wrapt up in leaves so that no
          part of it should touch the hands of the bearer: the second carried
          a piece of baked pork similarly enveloped: the third held a
          drinking-cup full of water and wrapt round with native cloth; and
          the fourth bore a napkin of the same stuff. The first elder passed
          along the row of novices putting the end of the yam into each of
          their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name=
          "Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> mouths, and as he
          did so each of them nibbled a morsel of the sacred food: the second
          elder did the same with the hallowed pork: the third elder followed
          with the holy water, with which each novice merely wetted his lips;
          and the fourth elder wiped all their mouths with his napkin. Then
          the high priest or one of the elders addressed the young men,
          warning them solemnly against the sacrilege of betraying to the
          profane vulgar any of the high mysteries which they had witnessed,
          and threatening all such traitors with the vengeance of the gods.
          The general intention of the initiatory rites seems to have been to
          introduce the young men to the worshipful spirits of the dead at
          their temple, and to cement the bond between them by a sacramental
          meal.<a id="noteref_637" name="noteref_637" href=

          at which one or two disguised men, their heads covered with wooden

          men. They demand that the circumcised boys who have not yet been

          boys, trembling and shrieking, are delivered to them, and must
          creep between the legs of the disguised men. Then the procession
          moves through the village again, and announces that Marsaba has
          eaten up the boys, and will not disgorge them till he receives a
          present of pigs, taro, and so forth. So all the villagers,
          according to their means, contribute provisions, which are then

          New Britain all males are members of an association called the
          Duk-duk. The boys are admitted to it very young, but are not fully
          initiated till their fourteenth year, when they receive from the
          Tubuvan or Tubuan a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
          247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          terrible blow with a cane, which is supposed to kill them. The
          Tubuan and the Duk-duk are two disguised men who represent
          cassowaries. They dance with a short hopping step in imitation of
          the cassowary. Each of them wears a huge hat like an extinguisher,
          woven of grass or palm-fibres; it is six feet high, and descends to
          the wearer's shoulders, completely concealing his head and face.
          From the neck to the knees the man's body is hidden by a crinoline
          made of the leaves of a certain tree fastened on hoops, one above
          the other. The Tubuan is regarded as a female, the Duk-duk as a
          male. The former is supposed to breed and give birth to the
          novices, who are accordingly looked upon as newly born. The female
          masks are very plain compared with the male masks. Two of them are
          regularly kept from year to year in order that they may annually
          breed new Duk-duks. When they are wanted for this purpose they are
          brought forth, decorated afresh, and provided with new leaf dresses
          to match. According to one account, women and children may not look
          upon one of these disguised men or they would die. So strong is
          this superstition among them that they will run away and hide as
          soon as they hear him coming, for they are aware of his approach
          through a peculiar shrieking noise he utters as he goes along. In
          the district of Berara, where red is the Duk-duk colour, the mere
          sight of a red cloth is enough to make the women take to their
          heels. The common herd are not allowed to know who the masker is.
          If he stumbles and his hat falls to the ground, disclosing his
          face, or his crinoline is torn to tatters by the bushes, his
          attendants immediately surround him to hide his person from the
          vulgar eye. According to one writer, indeed, the performer who
          drops his mask, or lets it fall so that the sharp point at the top
          sticks in the ground, is put to death. The institution of the
          Duk-duk is common to the neighbouring islands of New Ireland and
          the Duke of York.<a id="noteref_639" name="noteref_639" href=

          Galelareese and Tobelorese of Halmahera, an island to the west of
          New Guinea, boys go through a form of initiation, part of which
          seems to consist in a pretence of begetting them anew. When a
          number of boys have reached the proper age, their parents agree to
          celebrate the ceremony at their common expense, and they invite
          others to be present at it. A shed is erected, and two long tables
          are placed in it, with benches to match, one for the men and one
          for the women. When all the preparations have been made for a
          feast, a great many skins of the rayfish, and some pieces of a wood
          which imparts a red colour to water, are taken to the shed. A
          priest or elder causes a vessel to be placed in the sight of all
          the people, and then begins, with significant gestures, to rub a
          piece of the wood with the ray-skin. The powder so produced is put
          in the vessel, and at the same time the name of one of the boys is
          called out. The same proceeding is repeated for each boy. Then the
          vessels are filled with water, after which the feast begins. At the
          third cock-crow the priest smears the faces and bodies of the boys
          with the red water, which represents the blood shed at the
          perforation of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          are taken to the wood, and must hide behind the largest trees. The
          men, armed with sword and shield, accompany them, dancing and
          singing. The priest knocks thrice on each of the trees behind which
          a boy is hiding. All day the boys stay in the wood, exposing
          themselves to the heat of the sun as much as possible. In the
          evening they bathe and return to the shed, where the women supply
          them with food.<a id="noteref_640" name="noteref_640" href=

          Modern writers have commonly regarded this association as primarily
          a political league instituted to resist foreign domination. In
          reality its objects are purely religious and social, though it is
          possible that the priests may have occasionally used their powerful
          influence for political ends. The society is in fact merely one of
          those widely-diffused primitive institutions, of which a chief
          object is the initiation of young men. In recent years the true
          nature of the association has been duly recognized by the
          distinguished Dutch ethnologist, J. G. F. Riedel. The Kakian house
          is an oblong wooden shed, situated under the darkest trees in the
          depth of the forest, and is built to admit so little light that it
          is impossible to see what goes on in it. Every village has such a
          house. Thither the boys who are to be initiated are conducted
          blindfold, followed by their parents and relations. Each boy is led
          by the hand by two men, who act as his sponsors or guardians,
          looking after him during the period of initiation. When all are
          assembled before the shed, the high priest calls aloud upon the
          devils. Immediately a hideous uproar is heard to proceed from the
          shed. It is made by men with bamboo trumpets, who have been
          secretly introduced into the building by a back door, but the women
          and children think it is made by the devils, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and are much terrified. Then the
          priests enter the shed, followed by the boys, one at a time. As
          soon as each boy has disappeared within the precincts, a dull
          chopping sound is heard, a fearful cry rings out, and a sword or
          spear, dripping with blood, is thrust through the roof of the shed.
          This is a token that the boy's head has been cut off, and that the
          devil has carried him away to the other world, there to regenerate
          and transform him. So at sight of the bloody sword the mothers weep
          and wail, crying that the devil has murdered their children. In
          some places, it would seem, the boys are pushed through an opening
          made in the shape of a crocodile's jaws or a cassowary's beak, and
          it is then said that the devil has swallowed them. The boys remain
          in the shed for five or nine days. Sitting in the dark, they hear
          the blast of the bamboo trumpets, and from time to time the sound
          of musket shots and the clash of swords. Every day they bathe, and
          their faces and bodies are smeared with a yellow dye, to give them
          the appearance of having been swallowed by the devil. During his
          stay in the Kakian house each boy has one or two crosses tattooed
          with thorns on his breast or arm. When they are not sleeping, the
          lads must sit in a crouching posture without moving a muscle. As
          they sit in a row cross-legged, with their hands stretched out, the
          chief takes his trumpet, and placing the mouth of it on the hands
          of each lad, speaks through it in strange tones, imitating the
          voice of the spirits. He warns the lads, under pain of death, to
          observe the rules of the Kakian society, and never to reveal what
          has passed in the Kakian house. The novices are also told by the
          priests to behave well to their blood relations, and are taught the
          traditions and secrets of the tribe.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime the
          mothers and sisters of the lads have gone home to weep and mourn.
          But in a day or two the men who acted as guardians or sponsors to
          the novices return to the village with the glad tidings that the
          devil, at the intercession of the priests, has restored the lads to
          life. The men who bring this news come in a fainting state and
          daubed with mud, like messengers freshly arrived from the nether
          world. Before leaving the Kakian house, each lad receives from the
          priest a stick adorned at both ends with <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> cock's or cassowary's feathers. The sticks
          are supposed to have been given to the lads by the devil at the
          time when he restored them to life, and they serve as a token that
          the youths have been in the spirit land. When they return to their
          homes they totter in their walk, and enter the house backward, as
          if they had forgotten how to walk properly; or they enter the house
          by the back door. If a plate of food is given to them, they hold it
          upside down. They remain dumb, indicating their wants by signs
          only. All this is to shew that they are still under the influence
          of the devil or the spirits. Their sponsors have to teach them all
          the common acts of life, as if they were new-born children.
          Further, upon leaving the Kakian house the boys are strictly
          forbidden to eat of certain fruits until the next celebration of
          the rites has taken place. And for twenty or thirty days their hair
          may not be combed by their mothers or sisters. At the end of that
          time the high priest takes them to a lonely place in the forest,
          and cuts off a lock of hair from the crown of each of their heads.
          After these initiatory rites the lads are deemed men, and may
          marry; it would be a scandal if they married before.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the region of
          the Lower Congo a simulation of death and resurrection is, or
          rather used to be, practised by the members of a guild or secret
          society called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ndembo</span></span>. The society had nothing
          to do with puberty or circumcision, though the custom of
          circumcision is common in the country. Young people and adults of
          both sexes might join the guild; after initiation they were called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Knowing Ones”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nganga</span></span>). To found a branch of
          the society it was necessary to have an albino, who, whether a
          child, lad, or adult, was the acknowledged head of the
          society.<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642" href=
          "#note_642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">642</span></span></a> The
          ostensible reason for starting a branch of the guild in a district
          was commonly an epidemic of sickness, <span class="tei tei-q">“and
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name=
          "Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> idea was to go into
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ndembo</span></span> to die, and after an
          indefinite period, from a few months to two or three years, to be
          resurrected with a new body not liable to the sickness then
          troubling the countryside. Another reason for starting a
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ndembo</span></span> was a dearth of children
          in a district. It was believed that good luck in having children
          would attend those who entered or died <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ndembo</span></span>. But the underlying idea
          was the same, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> to get a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘new body’</span> that would be healthy and perform its
          functions properly.”</span> The quarters of the society were always
          a stockaded enclosure in a great thick forest; a gate of planks
          painted yellow and red gave access to it, and within there was an
          assemblage of huts. The place was fenced to keep intruders from
          prying into the mysteries of the guild, and it was near water.
          Uninitiated persons might walk on the public roads through the
          forest, but if they were caught in bye-paths or hunting in the
          woods, they were flogged, fined, and sometimes killed. They might
          not even look upon the persons of those who had <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“died <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ndembo</span></span>”</span>; hence when these
          sanctified persons were roving about the forest or going to the
          river, the booming notes of a drum warned the profane vulgar to
          keep out of their way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
          stockade and the huts in the forest were ready to receive all who
          wished to put off the old man or woman and to put on the new, one
          of the initiates gave the sign and the aspirant after the higher
          life dropped down like dead in some public place, it might be the
          market or the centre of the town where there were plenty of people
          to witness the edifying spectacle. The initiates immediately spread
          a pall over him or her, beat the earth round about the pretended
          corpse with plantain stalks, chanted incantations, fired guns, and
          cut capers. Then they carried the seemingly dead body away into the
          forest and disappeared with it into the stockade. The spectacle
          proved infectious; one after another in the emotional, excitable
          crowd of negroes followed the example, dropped down like dead, and
          were carried off, sometimes in a real cataleptic state. In this way
          fifty to a hundred or more novices might feign death and be
          transported into the sacred enclosure. There they were supposed not
          only to die but to rot till only a single <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class=

          initiated had to take the greatest care in expectation of the
          joyful resurrection that was soon to follow. However, though they
          were both dead and rotten, they consumed a large quantity of food,
          which their credulous relatives brought to them in baskets, toiling
          with the loads on their backs over the long paths through the
          forest in the sweltering heat of the tropical day. If the relations
          failed to discharge this pious and indispensable duty, their
          kinsman in the sacred enclosure ran a risk of dying in good
          earnest, or rather of being spirited away to a distant town and
          sold as a slave.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shut up within
          the stockade for months or years, the men and women, boys and
          girls, dispensed with the superfluity of clothes, rubbed their
          naked bodies with red ochre or powdered camwood instead, and gave
          themselves up to orgies of unbridled lust. Some feeble attempts
          were made to teach them the rudiments of a secret language, but the
          vocabulary was small and its principles lacking in ingenuity. The
          time during which this seclusion lasted might vary from three
          months to three years. When the circumstances which had furnished
          the pretext for instituting the society had passed away, whether it
          was that the epidemic had died out or that the birth-rate had
          sensibly increased, murmurs would begin to be heard among friends
          and relatives in the town, who did not see why they should be taxed
          any longer to support a set of idle and dissolute ruffians in the
          forest, and why they should trudge day after day in the sweat of
          their brow to carry provisions to them. So the supplies would begin
          to run short, and whenever that happened the mystery of the
          resurrection was sure to follow very soon after.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly it
          would be announced that on a certain market-day the new initiates,
          now raised from the dead, would reveal themselves in all their
          glory to the astonished gaze of the public. The glad tidings were
          received with enthusiasm, and crowds assembled from all the country
          round about to welcome those who had come back from the world
          beyond the grave. When all were gathered in eager expectancy in the
          market-place, the sounds of distant music would be heard, and soon
          the gay procession would defile into the open square and march
          round it, while the dusky skins, reddened with camwood <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> powder, glistened in the sunshine, the
          gay garments fluttered in the wind, and the tassels of palm-leaf
          fibre dangled at every arm. In the crowd of spectators many parents
          would recognize their children in the marching figures of the
          procession, and girls and boys would point out their brothers and
          sisters and eagerly call out their names. But in the stolid faces
          of the initiates not an eye would gleam with recognition, not a
          muscle would twitch with an involuntary expression of delight; for
          having just been raised from the dead they were supposed to know
          nothing of their former life, of friends and relations, of home and
          country. There might be in the crowd a mother or a sister not seen
          for years; or, more moving still, the novice might look in vain for
          loved and remembered faces that would never be seen in the
          market-place again. But whatever his feelings might be, he must
          rigidly suppress them under pain of a flogging, a fine, or even
          death. At last the parade was over and the procession broke up.
          Then the old hands introduced the new hands to their own parents
          and brothers and sisters, to their old homes and haunts. For still
          the novices kept up the pretence that everything was new and
          strange to them, that they could not speak their mother tongue,
          that they did not know their own fathers and mothers, their own
          town and their own houses; nay that they had forgotten even how to
          eat their food. So everything and everybody had to be shewn to them
          and their names and meanings explained. Their guides would lead
          them about the town, pointing out the various roads and telling
          where they led to—this one to the watering-place on the river, this
          to the forest, that to the farms, and so on: they would take up the
          commonest domestic utensils and shew what they were used for: they
          would even chew the food and put it into the mouths of the novices,
          like mother birds feeding their callow young. For some time
          afterwards the resuscitated persons, attended by their mentors,
          would go about the town and the neighbourhood acting in a strange
          way like children or mad folk, seizing what they wanted and trying
          to beat or even kill such as dared to refuse them anything. Their
          guardian would generally restrain these sallies; but sometimes he
          would arrange with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
          255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          his hopeful pupils to be out of sight when two or three of them
          clubbed together to assault and rob an honest man, and would only
          return in time to share the booty. After a while, however, the
          excitement created by the resurrection would wear off; the dead
          folk come to life were expected to have learned their lessons, and
          if they forgot themselves, their memory was promptly refreshed by
          the law.<a id="noteref_643" name="noteref_643" href=

          dies, the fetish priests carefully collect his bones in order to
          bring them to life again, and they nourish them, that he may be
          clothed anew in flesh and blood. But it is not good to speak of it.
          In the land of Ambamba every one must die once, and when the fetish
          priest shakes his calabash against a village, all the men and lads
          whose hour is come fall into a state of lifeless torpidity, from
          which they generally arise after three days. But if the fetish
          loves a man he carries him away into the bush and buries him in the
          fetish house, often for many years. When he comes to life again, he
          begins to eat and drink as before, but his understanding is gone
          and the fetish man must teach him and direct him in every motion,
          like the smallest child. At first this can only be done with a
          stick, but gradually his senses return, so that it is possible to
          talk with him, and when his education is complete, the priest
          brings him back to his parents. They would seldom recognize their
          son but for the express assurances of the fetish priest, who
          moreover recalls previous events to their memory. He who has not
          gone through the ceremony of the new birth in Ambamba is

          normal state, bear the name of Swamie (a sacred designation also in
          India) or, if they are women, Sumbo (Tembo), and wear as a token
          the ring called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          Similarly among the Fans of the Gaboon a young warrior acquires his
          guardian spirit by dreaming. He is secluded in the forest, drinks a
          fermented and intoxicating liquor, and smokes hemp. Then he falls
          into a heavy sleep, and next morning he must describe exactly to
          the fetish priest the animal, tree, mineral, or whatever it may
          have been which he saw in his dream. This magical dream is repeated
          on three successive nights; and after that the young man is sent
          forth by the priest to seek and bring back the beast, bird,
          reptile, or whatever it was of which he dreamed. The youth obeys,
          reduces the animal or thing to cinders or ashes, and preserves
          these calcined remains as a talisman which will protect him against
          many dangers.<a id="noteref_646" name="noteref_646" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rites of death
          and resurrection were formerly observed in Quoja, on the west coast
          of Africa, to the north of the Congo. They are thus described by an
          old writer:—<span class="tei tei-q">“They have another ceremony
          which they call Belli-Paaro, but it is not for everybody. For it is
          an incorporation in the assembly of the spirits, and confers the
          right of entering their groves, that is to say, of going and eating
          the offerings which the simple folk bring thither. The initiation
          or admission to the Belli-Paaro is celebrated every twenty or
          twenty-five years. The initiated recount marvels of the ceremony,
          saying that they are roasted, that they entirely change their
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name=
          "Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> habits and life, and
          that they receive a spirit quite different from that of other
          people and quite new lights. The badge of membership consists in
          some lines traced on the neck between the shoulders; the lines seem
          to be pricked with a needle. Those who have this mark pass for
          persons of spirit, and when they have attained a certain age they
          are allowed a voice in all public assemblies; whereas the
          uninitiated are regarded as profane, impure, and ignorant persons,
          who dare not express an opinion on any subject of importance. When
          the time for the ceremony has come, it is celebrated as follows. By
          order of the king a place is appointed in the forest, whither they
          bring the youths who have not been marked, not without much crying
          and weeping; for it is impressed upon the youths that in order to
          undergo this change it is necessary to suffer death. So they
          dispose of their property, as if it were all over with them. There
          are always some of the initiated beside the novices to instruct
          them. They teach them to dance a certain dance called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">killing</span></span>, and to sing verses in
          praise of Belli. Above all, they are very careful not to let them
          die of hunger, because if they did so, it is much to be feared that
          the spiritual resurrection would profit them nothing. This manner
          of life lasts five or six years, and is comfortable enough, for
          there is a village in the forest, and they amuse themselves with
          hunting and fishing. Other lads are brought thither from time to
          time, so that the last comers have not long to stay. No woman or
          uninitiated person is suffered to pass within four or five leagues
          of the sacred wood. When their instruction is completed, they are
          taken from the wood and shut up in small huts made for the purpose.
          Here they begin once more to hold communion with mankind and to
          talk with the women who bring them their food. It is amusing to see
          their affected simplicity. They pretend to know no one, and to be
          ignorant of all the customs of the country, such as the customs of
          washing themselves, rubbing themselves with oil, and so forth. When
          they enter these huts, their bodies are all covered with the
          feathers of birds, and they wear caps of bark which hang down
          before their faces. But after a time they are dressed in clothes
          and taken to a great open place, where all the people of the
          neighbourhood <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg
          259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          are assembled. Here the novices give the first proof of their
          capacity by dancing a dance which is called the dance of Belli.
          After the dance is over, the novices are taken to the houses of
          their parents by their instructors.”</span><a id="noteref_647"

          informs us that <span class="tei tei-q">“the great point of
          agreement between all these West African secret societies lies in
          the methods of initiation. The boy, if he belongs to a tribe that
          goes in for tattooing, is tattooed, and is handed over to
          instructors in the societies' secrets and formulae. He lives, with
          the other boys of his tribe undergoing initiation, usually under
          the rule of several instructors, and for the space of one year. He
          lives always in the forest, and is naked and smeared with clay. The
          boys are exercised so as to become inured to hardship; in some
          districts, they make raids so as to perfect themselves in this
          useful accomplishment. They always take a new name, and are
          supposed by the initiation process to become new beings in the
          magic wood, and on their return to their village at the end of
          their course, they pretend to have entirely forgotten their life
          before they entered the wood; but this pretence is not kept up
          beyond the period of festivities given to welcome them home. They
          all learn, to a certain extent, a new language, a secret language
          only understood by the initiated. The same removal from home and
          instruction from initiated members is observed also with the girls.
          However, in their case, it is not always a forest-grove they are
          secluded in, sometimes it is done in huts. Among the Grain Coast
          tribes, however, the girls go into a magic wood until they are
          married. Should they have to leave the wood for any temporary
          reason, they must smear themselves with white clay. A similar
          custom holds good in Okÿon, Calabar district, where, should a girl
          have to leave the fattening-house, she must be covered with white
          clay.”</span><a id="noteref_648" name="noteref_648" href=

          a prompt and implicit obedience to every order of their superiors.
          Boys of seven or eight years of age are admitted, or rather serve a
          novitiate until they arrive at a proper age; for it is difficult to
          procure exact information, and even somewhat dangerous to make many
          inquiries. Every person on entering the society lays aside his
          former name and assumes a new one; to call him by his old name
          would produce a dispute. They have a superior or head <span class=

          council, whose commands are received with the most profound
          reverence and absolute submission, both by the subordinate councils
          and by individuals. Their meetings are held in the most retired
          spots, amid the gloom of night, and carried on with inquisitorial
          secrecy. When the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          is always at night, it is accompanied with the most dreadful
          howlings, screams, and other horrid noises. The inhabitants, who
          are not members of the society, are obliged to secure themselves
          within doors; should any one be discovered without, or attempting
          to peep at what is going forward, he would inevitably be put to
          death. To restrain the curiosity of the females, they are ordered
          to continue within doors, clapping their hands incessantly, so long
          as the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          offences, particularly of witchcraft and murder, but above all of
          contumacy and disobedience in any of its own members, and punishes
          the guilty with death in so secret and sudden a manner, that the

          dead another elder is called in to act as proxy in his stead, or if
          the mother is not living another woman to act in her place. Any
          woman thus acting as representative is looked upon in future by the
          boy as his own mother. A goat or sheep is killed in the afternoon
          by any one, usually not by the father, and the stomach and
          intestines reserved. The ceremony begins in the evening. A piece of
          skin is cut in a circle, and passed over one shoulder of the
          candidate and under the other arm. The stomach of the goat is
          similarly treated and passed over the other shoulder and under the
          other arm. All the boy's ornaments are removed, but not his
          clothes. No men are allowed inside the hut, but women are present.
          The mother sits on a hide on the floor with the boy between
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name=
          "Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> her knees. The
          sheep's gut is passed round the woman and brought in front of the
          boy. The woman groans as in labour, another woman cuts the gut, and
          the boy imitates the cry of a new-born infant. The women present
          all applaud, and afterwards the assistant and the mother wash the
          boy. That night the boy sleeps in the same hut as the
          mother.”</span><a id="noteref_653" name="noteref_653" href=

          the cutting of the sheep's gut, which unites the mother to the boy,
          is clearly an imitation of severing the navel string. Nor is it
          boys alone who are born again among the Akikuyu. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Girls go through the rite of second birth as well as
          boys. It is sometimes administered to infants. At one time the new
          birth was combined with circumcision, and so the ceremony admitted
          to the privileges and religious rites of the tribe. Afterwards
          trouble took place on account of mere boys wishing to take their
          place alongside of the young men and maintaining they were
          justified in doing so. The old men then settled the matter by
          separating the two. Unless the new birth has been administered the
          individual is not in a position to be admitted to circumcision,
          which is the outward sign of admittance to the nation. Any who have
          not gone through the rite cannot inherit property, nor take any
          part in the religious rites of the country.”</span><a id=

          carrying his dying father out into the wilds and for disposing of
          his body after death. The new birth seems to take place usually
          about the tenth year, but the age varies with the ability of the

          the Bushongo, who inhabit a district of the Belgian Congo bounded
          on the north and east by the Sankuru River and on the west by the
          Kasai, young boys had formerly to undergo certain rites of
          initiation, amongst which a simulation of killing them would seem
          to have had a place, though in recent times the youths have been
          allowed to escape the ordeal by the payment of a fine. The supreme
          chief of the tribe, who in old days bore the title of God on Earth
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Chembe Kunji</span></span>), used to assemble
          all the lads who had just reached puberty and send them away into
          the forest, where they remained for several months under the care
          of one of his sons. During their seclusion they were deemed unclean
          and might see no one; if they chanced to meet a woman, she had to
          flee before them. By night the old men marched round the quarters
          of the novices, raising hideous cries and whirling bull-roarers,
          the noise of which the frightened lads took to be the voices of
          ghosts. They wore nothing but a comb, and passed their leisure
          hours in learning to make mats and baskets. After about a month
          they had to submit to the first ordeal. A trench about ten feet
          deep was dug in the ground and roofed over with sticks and earth so
          as to form a dark tunnel. In the sides of the tunnel were cut
          niches, and in each niche a man took post, whose business it was to
          terrify the novices. For this purpose one of them was disguised in
          the skin of a leopard, a second was dressed as a warrior with a
          knife in his hand, a third was a smith with his furnace and red-hot
          irons, and a fourth was masked to look like an ugly ape, while he
          too gripped a knife in his hand. The novices generally recoiled in
          dismay from each of these apparitions, and it was only by means of
          reiterated taunts and threats that the elders forced them to
          traverse the whole length of the tunnel. After the lapse of another
          month the youths had to face another ordeal of a similar character.
          A low tunnel, about three feet deep, was dug in the earth, and
          sticks were inserted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg
          265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          in it so that their tops projected from the surface of the ground.
          At the end of the tunnel a calabash was set full of goat's blood.
          By way of encouraging the timid novices the master of the
          ceremonies himself crawled through the tunnel, his progress under
          ground being revealed to the novices above ground by the vibrations
          of the sticks with which he collided in the dark passage. Then
          having bedabbled his nose, his mouth, and all the rest of his body
          with the goat's blood, he emerged from the tunnel on hands and
          knees, dripping with gore and to all appearance in the last stage
          of exhaustion. Then he lay prostrate on his stomach in a state of
          collapse; the elders declared him to be dead and carried him off.
          The chief now ordered the lads to imitate the example set them by
          the master of the ceremonies, but they begged and prayed to be
          excused. At first the chief was inexorable, but in time he relented
          and agreed to accept a fine of so many cowries as a ransom paid by
          the youths for exemption from the ordeal. A month later the last of
          the ordeals took place. A great trunk of a tree was buried with its
          lower end in the earth and surrounded for three-quarters of its
          circumference with arrows stuck in the ground so that the barbs
          were pointed towards the tree. The chief and the leading men sat
          down at the gap in the circle of arrows, so as to conceal the gap
          from the eyes of the novices and other spectators, among whom the
          women were allowed to be present. To the eyes of the uninitiated it
          now seemed that the tree was surrounded by a bristling hedge of
          arrows, to fall upon which would be death. All being ready the
          master of the ceremonies climbed the tree amid breathless silence,
          and having reached the top, which was decorated with a bunch of
          leaves, he looked about him and asked the women, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Shall I come down?”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No! no!”</span> they shrieked, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you will be killed by the arrows.”</span> Then,
          turning disdainfully from these craven souls, the gallant man
          addressed himself to the youths and repeated his question,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I come down?”</span> A shout of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes!”</span> gave the answer that might
          have been expected from these heroic spirits. In response the
          master of the ceremonies at once slid down the tree and, dropping
          neatly to the ground just at the gap in the hedge of arrows,
          presented himself unscathed to the gaze of the excited assembly.
          The chief <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg
          266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          now ordered the young men to go up and do likewise. But the
          dauntless courage with which they had contemplated the descent of
          the master of the ceremonies entirely forsook them when it came to
          their turn to copy his shining example. Their mothers, too, raised
          a loud cry of protest, joining their prayers and entreaties to
          those of their hopeful sons. After some discussion the chief
          consented to accept a ransom, and the novices were dispensed from
          the ordeal. Then they bathed and were deemed to have rid themselves
          of their uncleanness, but they had still to work for the chief for
          three months before they ranked as full-grown men and might return
          to their villages.<a id="noteref_657" name="noteref_657" href=

          sixteen or twenty years, or oftener, as the young men happened to
          grow up. The youths were kept in solitary confinement in the woods
          for several months, receiving no food but an infusion of some
          intoxicating roots, so that they went raving mad, and continued in
          this state eighteen or twenty days. <span class="tei tei-q">“Upon
          this occasion it is pretended that these poor creatures drink so
          much of the water of Lethe that they perfectly lose the remembrance

          their language. When the doctors find that they have drunk
          sufficiently of the Wysoccan (so they call this mad potion), they
          gradually restore them to their senses again by lessening the
          intoxication of their diet; but before they are perfectly well they
          bring them back into their towns, while they are still wild and
          crazy through the violence of the medicine. After this they are
          very fearful of discovering anything of their former remembrance;

          time the usage is so severe that seldom any one escapes with life.
          Thus they must pretend to have forgot the very use of their
          tongues, so as not to be able to speak, nor understand anything
          that is spoken, till they learn it again. Now, whether this be real
          or counterfeit, I don't know; but certain it is that they

          the Indian tribes of North America there exist certain religious
          associations which are only open to candidates who have gone
          through a pretence of being killed and brought to life again. In
          1766 or 1767 Captain Jonathan Carver witnessed the admission of a
          candidate to an association called <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          friendly society of the Spirit”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Wakon-Kitchewah</span></span>) among the
          Naudowessies, a Siouan or Dacotan tribe in the region of the great
          lakes. The candidate knelt before the chief, who told him that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“he himself was now agitated by the same
          spirit which he should in a few moments communicate to him; that it
          would strike him dead, but that he would instantly be restored
          again to life; to this he added, that the communication, however
          terrifying, was a necessary introduction to the advantages enjoyed
          by the community into which he was on the point of being admitted.
          As he spoke this, he appeared to be greatly agitated; till at last
          his emotions became so violent, that his countenance was distorted,
          and his whole frame convulsed. At this juncture he threw something
          that appeared both in shape and colour like a small bean, at the
          young man, which seemed to enter his mouth, and he instantly fell
          as motionless as if he had been shot.”</span> For a time the man
          lay like dead, but under a shower of blows he shewed signs of
          consciousness, and finally, discharging from his mouth the bean, or
          whatever it was that the chief had thrown at him, he came to
          life.<a id="noteref_659" name="noteref_659" href=
          "#note_659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          other tribes, for example, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Ojebways, Winnebagoes, and Dacotas or Sioux,
          the instrument by which the candidate is apparently slain is the
          medicine-bag. The bag is made of the skin of an animal (such as the
          otter, wild cat, serpent, bear, raccoon, wolf, owl, weasel), of
          which it roughly preserves the shape. Each member of the society
          has one of these bags, in which he keeps the odds and ends that
          make up his <span class="tei tei-q">“medicine”</span> or charms.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“They believe that from the miscellaneous
          contents in the belly of the skin bag or animal there issues a
          spirit or breath, which has the power, not only to knock down and
          kill a man, but also to set him up and restore him to life.”</span>
          The mode of killing a man with one of these medicine-bags is to
          thrust it at him; he falls like dead, but a second thrust of the
          bag restores him to life.<a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660"
          href="#note_660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">660</span></span></a> Among
          the Dacotas the institution of the medicine-bag or mystery-sack was
          attributed to Onktehi, the great spirit of the waters, who ordained
          that the bag should consist of the skin of the otter, raccoon,
          weasel, squirrel, or loon, or a species of fish and of serpents.
          Further, he decreed that the bag should contain four sorts of
          medicines of magical qualities, which should represent fowls,
          quadrupeds, herbs, and trees. Accordingly, swan's down, buffalo
          hair, grass roots, and bark from the roots of trees are kept by the
          Dacotas in their medicine-bags. From this combination there
          proceeds a magical influence (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tonwan</span></span>) so powerful that no
          human being can of his own strength withstand it. When the god of
          the waters had prepared the first medicine-bag, he tested its
          powers on four candidates for initiation, who all perished under
          the shock. So he consulted with his wife, the goddess of the earth,
          and by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg
          269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          holding up his left hand and pattering on the back of it with the
          right, he produced myriads of little shells, whose virtue is to
          restore life to those who have been slain by the medicine-bag.
          Having taken this precaution, the god chose four other candidates
          and repeated the experiment of initiation with success, for after
          killing them with the bag he immediately resuscitated them by
          throwing one of the shells into their vital parts, while he chanted
          certain words assuring them that it was only sport and bidding them
          rise to their feet. That is why to this day every initiated Dacota
          has one of these shells in his body. Such was the divine origin of
          the medicine-dance of the Dacotas. The initiation takes place in a
          special tent. The candidate, after being steamed in a vapour-bath
          for four successive days, plants himself on a pile of blankets, and
          behind him stands an aged member of the order. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Now the master of the ceremonies, with the joints of
          his knees and hips considerably bent, advances with an unsteady,
          uncouth hitching, sack in hand, wearing an aspect of desperate
          energy, and uttering his <span class="tei tei-q">‘Heen, heen,
          heen’</span> with frightful emphasis, while all around are
          enthusiastic demonstrations of all kinds of wild passions. At this
          point the sack is raised near a painted spot on the breast of the
          candidate, at which the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tonwan</span></span> is discharged. At the
          instant the brother from behind gives him a push and he falls dead,
          and is covered with blankets. Now the frenzied dancers gather
          around, and in the midst of bewildering and indescribable noises,
          chant the words uttered by the god at the institution of the
          ceremony, as already recorded. Then the master throws off the
          covering, and chewing a piece of the bone of the Onktehi, spirts it
          over him, and he begins to show signs of returning life. Then as
          the master pats energetically upon the breast of the initiated
          person, he, convulsed, strangling, struggling, and agonizing,
          heaves up the shell which falls from his mouth on a sack placed in
          readiness to receive it. Life is restored and entrance effected
          into the awful mysteries. He belongs henceforth to the
          medicine-dance, and has a right to enjoy the
          medicine-feast.”</span><a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A ceremony
          witnessed by the castaway John R. Jewitt during his captivity among
          the Indians of Nootka Sound doubtless belongs to this class of
          customs. The Indian king or chief <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“discharged a pistol close to his son's ear, who
          immediately fell down as if killed, upon which all the women of the
          house set up a most lamentable cry, tearing handfuls of hair from
          their heads, and exclaiming that the prince was dead; at the same
          time a great number of the inhabitants rushed into the house armed
          with their daggers, muskets, etc., enquiring the cause of their
          outcry. These were immediately followed by two others dressed in
          wolf skins, with masks over their faces representing the head of
          that animal. The latter came in on their hands and feet in the
          manner of a beast, and taking up the prince, carried him off upon
          their backs, retiring in the same manner they
          entered.”</span><a id="noteref_662" name="noteref_662" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">662</span></span></a> In
          another place Jewitt mentions that the young prince—a lad of about
          eleven years of age—wore a mask in imitation of a wolf's
          head.<a id="noteref_663" name="noteref_663" href=

          as the Indians of this part of America are divided into totem
          clans, of which the Wolf clan is one of the principal, and as the
          members of each clan are in the habit of wearing some portion of
          the totem animal about their person,<a id="noteref_664" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">664</span></span></a> it is
          probable that the prince belonged to the Wolf clan, and that the
          ceremony described by Jewitt represented the killing of the lad in
          order that he might be born anew as a wolf, much in the same way
          that the Basque hunter supposed himself to have been killed and to
          have come to life again as a bear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This conjectural
          explanation of the ceremony has, since it was first put forward,
          been confirmed by the researches of Dr. Franz Boas among these
          Indians; though it would seem <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> that the community to which the chief's son
          thus obtained admission was not so much a totem clan as a secret
          society called Tlokoala, whose members imitated wolves. The name
          Tlokoala is a foreign word among the Nootka Indians, having been
          borrowed by them from the Kwakiutl Indians, in whose language the
          word means the finding of a <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">manitoo</span></span> or personal totem. The
          Nootka tradition runs that this secret society was instituted by
          wolves who took away a chief's son and tried to kill him, but,
          failing to do so, became his friends, taught him the rites of the
          society, and ordered him to teach them to his friends on his return
          home. Then they carried the young man back to his village. They
          also begged that whenever he moved from one place to another he
          would kindly leave behind him some red cedar-bark to be used by
          them in their own ceremonies; and to this custom the Nootka tribes
          still adhere. Every new member of the society must be initiated by
          the wolves. At night a pack of wolves, personated by Indians
          dressed in wolf-skins and wearing wolf-masks, make their
          appearance, seize the novice, and carry him into the woods. When
          the wolves are heard outside the village, coming to fetch away the
          novice, all the members of the society blacken their faces and
          sing, <span class="tei tei-q">“Among all the tribes is great
          excitement, because I am Tlokoala.”</span> Next day the wolves
          bring back the novice dead, and the members of the society have to
          revive him. The wolves are supposed to have put a magic stone into
          his body, which must be removed before he can come to life. Till
          this is done the pretended corpse is left lying outside the house.
          Two wizards go and remove the stone, which appears to be quartz,
          and then the novice is resuscitated.<a id="noteref_665" name=

          the Niska Indians of British Columbia, who are divided into four
          principal clans with the raven, the wolf, the eagle, and the bear
          for their respective totems, the novice at initiation is always
          brought back by an artificial totem animal. Thus when a
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name=
          "Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> man was about to be
          initiated into a secret society called Olala, his friends drew
          their knives and pretended to kill him. In reality they let him
          slip away, while they cut off the head of a dummy which had been
          adroitly substituted for him. Then they laid the decapitated dummy
          down and covered it over, and the women began to mourn and wail.
          His relations gave a funeral banquet and solemnly burnt the effigy.
          In short, they held a regular funeral. For a whole year the novice
          remained absent and was seen by none but members of the secret
          society. But at the end of that time he came back alive, carried by
          an artificial animal which represented his totem.<a id=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
          ceremonies the essence of the rite appears to be the killing of the
          novice in his character of a man and his restoration to life in the
          form of the animal which is thenceforward to be, if not his
          guardian spirit, at least linked to him in a peculiarly intimate
          relation. It is to be remembered that the Indians of Guatemala,
          whose life was bound up with an animal, were supposed to have the
          power of appearing in the shape of the particular creature with
          which they were thus sympathetically united.<a id="noteref_667"

          it seems not unreasonable to conjecture that in like manner the
          Indians of British Columbia may imagine that their life depends on
          the life of some one of that species of creature to which they
          assimilate themselves by their costume. At least if that is not an
          article of belief with the Columbian Indians of the present day, it
          may very well have been so with their ancestors in the past, and
          thus may have helped to mould the rites and ceremonies both of the
          totem clans and of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg
          273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          secret societies. For though these two sorts of communities differ
          in respect of the mode in which membership of them is obtained—a
          man being born into his totem clan but admitted into a secret
          society later in life—we can hardly doubt that they are near akin
          and have their root in the same mode of thought.<a id="noteref_668"

          thought, if I am right, is the possibility of establishing a
          sympathetic relation with an animal, a spirit, or other mighty
          being, with whom a man deposits for safe-keeping his soul or some
          part of it, and from whom he receives in return a gift of magical
          powers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Carrier
          Indians, who dwell further inland than the tribes we have just been
          considering, are divided into four clans with the grouse, the
          beaver, the toad, and the grizzly bear for their totems. But in
          addition to these clan totems the tribe recognized a considerable
          number of what Father Morice calls honorific totems, which could be
          acquired, through the performance of certain rites, by any person
          who wished to improve his social position. Each totem clan had a
          certain number of honorific totems or crests, and these might be
          assumed by any member of the clan who fulfilled the required
          conditions; but they could not be acquired by members of another
          clan. Thus the Grouse clan had for its honorific totems or crests
          the owl, the moose, the weasel, the crane, the wolf, the full moon,
          the wind, and so on; the Toad clan had the sturgeon, the porcupine,
          the wolverine, the red-headed woodpecker, the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“darding knife,”</span> and so forth; the Beaver clan
          had the mountain-goat for one of its <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> honorific totems; and the goose was a
          honorific totem of the Grizzly Bear clan. But the common bear, as a
          honorific totem or crest, might be assumed by anybody, whatever his
          clan. The common possession of a honorific totem appears to have
          constituted the same sort of bond among the Carrier Indians as the
          membership of a secret society does among the coast tribes of
          British Columbia; certainly the rites of initiation were similar.
          This will be clear from Father Morice's account of the
          performances, which I will subjoin in his own words. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The connection of the individual with his crest
          appeared more especially during ceremonial dances, when the former,
          attired, if possible, with the spoils of the latter, was wont to
          personate it in the gaze of an admiring assemblage. On all such
          occasions, man and totem were also called by the same name. The
          adoption of any such 'rite' or crest was usually accompanied by
          initiatory ceremonies or observances corresponding to the nature of
          the crest, followed in all cases by a distribution of clothes to
          all present. Thus whenever anybody resolved upon getting received
          as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Lulem</span></span> or Bear, he would,
          regardless of the season, divest himself of all his wearing apparel
          and don a bear-skin, whereupon he would dash into the woods there
          to remain for the space of three or four days and nights in
          deference to the wonts of his intended totem animal. Every night a
          party of his fellow-villagers would sally out in search of the
          missing <span class="tei tei-q">‘bear.’</span> To their loud calls:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Yi!
          Kelulem</span></span> (Come on, Bear!) he would answer by angry
          growls in imitation of the bear. The searching party making for the
          spot where he had been heard, would find by a second call followed
          by a similar answer that he had dexterously shifted to some
          opposite quarter in the forest. As a rule, he could not be found,
          but had to come back of himself, when he was speedily apprehended
          and conducted to the ceremonial lodge, where he would commence his
          first bear-dance in conjunction with all the other totem people,
          each of whom would then personate his own particular totem. Finally
          would take place the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">potlatch</span></span> [distribution of
          property] of the newly initiated <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘bear,’</span> who would not forget to present his
          captor with at least a whole dressed skin. The initiation to the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Darding Knife’</span> was quite a
          theatrical performance. A lance was prepared <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> which had a very sharp point so
          arranged that the slightest pressure on its tip would cause the
          steel to gradually sink into the shaft. In the sight of the
          multitude crowding the lodge, this lance was pressed on the bare
          chest of the candidate and apparently sunk in his body to the
          shaft, when he would tumble down simulating death. At the same time
          a quantity of blood—previously kept in the mouth—would issue from
          the would-be corpse, making it quite clear to the uninitiated
          gazers-on that the terrible knife had had its effect, when lo! upon
          one of the actors striking up one of the chants specially made for
          the circumstance and richly paid for, the candidate would gradually
          rise up a new man, the particular <span class=

          feature is the transformation of the man into his totem animal; in
          the latter it is his death and resurrection. But in substance,
          probably, both are identical. In both the novice dies as a man and
          revives as his totem, whether that be a bear, a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“darding”</span> knife, or what not; in other words, he
          has deposited his life or some portion of it in his totem, with
          which accordingly for the future he is more or less completely
          identified. Hard as it may be for us to conceive why a man should
          choose to identify himself with a knife, whether <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“darding”</span> or otherwise, we have to remember that
          in Celebes it is to a chopping-knife or other iron tool that the
          soul of a woman in labour is transferred for safety;<a id=

          the difference between a chopping-knife and a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“darding”</span> knife, considered as a receptacle for
          a human soul, is perhaps not very material. Among the Thompson
          Indians of British Columbia warriors who had a knife, an arrow, or
          any other weapon for their personal totem or guardian spirit,
          enjoyed this signal advantage over their fellows that they were for
          all practical purposes invulnerable. If an arrow did hit them,
          which seldom happened, they vomited <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the blood up, and the hurt soon healed. Hence
          these arrow-proof warriors rarely wore armour, which would indeed
          have been superfluous, and they generally took the most dangerous
          posts in battle. So convinced were the Thompson Indians of the
          power of their personal totem or guardian spirit to bring them back
          to life, that some of them killed themselves in the sure hope that
          the spirit would immediately raise them up from the dead. Others,
          more prudently, experimented on their friends, shooting them dead
          and then awaiting more or less cheerfully their joyful
          resurrection. We are not told that success crowned these
          experimental demonstrations of the immortality of the soul.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, on the
          theory here suggested, wherever totemism is found, and wherever a
          pretence is made of killing and bringing to life again the novice
          at initiation, there may exist or have existed not only a belief in
          the possibility of permanently depositing the soul in some external
          object—animal, plant, or what not—but an actual intention of so
          doing. If the question is put, why do men desire to deposit their
          life outside their bodies? the answer can only be that, like the
          giant in the fairy tale, they think it safer to do so than to carry
          it about with them, just as people deposit their money with a
          banker rather than carry it on their persons. We have seen that at
          critical periods the life or soul is sometimes temporarily stowed
          away in a safe place till the danger is past. But institutions like
          totemism are not resorted to merely on special occasions of danger;
          they are systems into which every one, or at least every male, is
          obliged to be initiated at a certain period of life. Now the period
          of life at which initiation takes place is regularly puberty; and
          this fact suggests that the special danger which totemism and
          systems like it are intended to obviate is supposed not to arise
          till sexual maturity has been attained, in fact, that the danger
          apprehended is believed to attend the relation of the sexes to each
          other. It would be easy to prove by a long array of facts that the
          sexual relation is associated in the primitive mind with many
          serious perils; but the exact nature of the danger apprehended is
          still <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name=
          "Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> obscure. We may hope
          that a more exact acquaintance with savage modes of thought will in
          time disclose this central mystery of primitive society, and will
          thereby furnish the clue, not only to totemism, but to the origin
          of the marriage system.</p>

        conceived as embodied in a particular object, with the existence of
        which his own existence is inseparably bound up, and the destruction
        of which involves his own, the object in question may be regarded and
        spoken of indifferently as his life or his death, as happens in the
        fairy tales. Hence if a man's death is in an object, it is perfectly
        natural that he should be killed by a blow from it. In the fairy

            contained the life of the oak may have been suggested by the

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea that the
        life of the oak was in the mistletoe was probably suggested, as I
        have said, by the observation that in winter the mistletoe growing on
        the oak remains green while the oak itself is leafless. But the
        position of the plant—growing not from the ground but from the trunk
        or branches of the tree—might confirm this idea. Primitive man might
        think that, like himself, the oak-spirit had sought to deposit his
        life in some safe place, and for this purpose had pitched on the
        mistletoe, which, being in a sense neither on earth nor in heaven,
        might be supposed to be fairly out of harm's way. In the first
        chapter we saw that primitive man seeks to preserve the life of his
        human divinities by keeping them poised between earth and heaven, as
        the place where they are least likely to be assailed by the dangers
        that encompass the life of man on earth. We can therefore understand
        why it has been a rule both of ancient and of modern folk-medicine
        that the mistletoe should not be allowed to touch the ground; were it
        to touch the ground, its healing virtue would be gone.<a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">679</span></span></a> This
        may be a survival of the old superstition that the plant in which the
        life of the sacred tree was concentrated should not be exposed to the
        risk incurred by contact with the earth. In an Indian legend, which
        offers a parallel to the Balder myth, Indra swore to the demon Namuci
        that he would slay him neither by day nor by night, neither with
        staff nor with bow, neither with the palm of the hand nor with the
        fist, neither with the wet nor with the dry. But he killed him in the
        morning twilight by sprinkling over him the foam of the sea.<a id=

        life in, because it occupies that sort of intermediate or nondescript
        position between earth and sky or sea and sky in which primitive man
        sees safety. It is therefore not surprising that the foam of the
        river should be the totem of a clan in India.<a id="noteref_681"

        you do not let it fall on the ground. Then place it under the roof on
        a spot under which you have laid various metals, and you will soon be
        surprised to see how that rod under the roof gradually bends in the
        direction of the metals. When your rod has sat there in the same spot
        for fourteen days or more, you take a knife or an awl, which has been
        stroked with a magnet, and with it you slit the bark on all sides,
        and pour or drop the blood of a cock (best of all the blood from the
        comb of a cock which is all of one colour) on the said slits in the
        bark; and when the blood has dried, the rod is ready and will give

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The view that the
        mistletoe was not merely the instrument of Balder's death, but that
        it contained his life, is countenanced by the analogy of a Scottish
        superstition. Tradition ran that the fate of the Hays of Errol, an
        estate in Perthshire, near the Firth of Tay, was bound up with the
        mistletoe that grew on a certain great oak. A member of the Hay
        family has recorded the old belief as follows: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Among the low country families the badges are now almost
        generally forgotten; but it appears by an ancient MS. and the
        tradition of a few old people in Perthshire, that the badge of the
        Hays was the mistletoe. There was formerly in the neighbourhood of
        Errol, and not far from the Falcon stone, a vast oak of an unknown
        age, and upon which grew a profusion of the plant: many charms and
        legends were considered to be connected with the tree, and the
        duration of the family of Hay was said to be united with its
        existence. It was believed that a sprig of the mistletoe cut by a Hay
        on Allhallowmas eve, with a new dirk, and after surrounding the tree
        three times sunwise, and pronouncing a certain spell, was a sure
        charm against all glamour or witchery, and an infallible guard in the
        day of battle. A spray gathered in the same manner was placed in the
        cradle of infants, and thought to defend them from being changed for
        elf-bairns by the fairies. Finally, it was affirmed, that when the
        root of the oak had perished, <span class="tei tei-q">‘the grass
        should grow in the hearth of Errol, and a raven should sit in the
        falcon's nest.’</span> The two most unlucky deeds which could be done
        by one of the name of Hay were, to kill a white falcon, and to cut
        down a limb from the oak of Errol. When the old tree was destroyed I
        could never learn. The estate has been some time sold out of the
        family of Hay, and of course it is said that the fatal oak was cut
        down a short time before.”</span><a id="noteref_688" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea that the
        fate of a family, as distinct from the lives of its members, is bound
        up with a particular plant or tree, is no doubt comparatively modern.
        The older view may have been that the lives of all the Hays were in
        this particular mistletoe, just as in the Indian story the lives of
        all the ogres are in a lemon; to break a twig of the mistletoe would
        then have been to kill one of the Hays. Similarly in the island of
        Rum, whose bold mountains the voyager from Oban to Skye observes to
        seaward, it was thought that if one of the family of Lachlin shot a
        deer on the mountain of Finchra, he would die suddenly or contract a
        distemper which would soon prove fatal.<a id="noteref_690" name=

        Probably the life of the Lachlins was bound up with the deer on
        Finchra, as the life of the Hays was bound up with the mistletoe on
        Errol's oak, and the life of the Dalhousie family with the Edgewell
        Tree.</p>

        poetical device to cast a mystic glamour over the humble plant. Or,
        more probably, his description was based on a popular superstition
        that at certain times the mistletoe blazed out into a supernatural
        golden glory. The poet tells how two doves, guiding Aeneas to the
        gloomy vale in whose depth grew the Golden Bough, alighted upon a
        tree, <span class="tei tei-q">“whence shone a flickering gleam of
        gold. As in the woods in winter cold the mistletoe—a plant not native
        to its tree—is green with fresh leaves and twines its yellow berries
        about the boles; such seemed upon the shady holm-oak the leafy gold,
        so rustled in the gentle breeze the golden leaf.”</span><a id=

        Virgil definitely describes the Golden Bough as growing on a
        holm-oak, and compares it with the mistletoe. The inference is almost
        inevitable that the Golden Bough was nothing but the mistletoe seen
        through the haze of poetry or of popular superstition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now grounds have
        been shewn for believing that the priest of the Arician grove—the
        King of the Wood—personified the tree on which grew the Golden

        if that tree was the oak, the King of the Wood must have been a
        personification of the oak-spirit. It is, therefore, easy to
        understand why, before he could be slain, it was necessary to break
        the Golden Bough. As an oak-spirit, his life or death was in the
        mistletoe on the oak, and so long as the mistletoe remained intact,
        he, like Balder, could not die. To slay him, therefore, it was
        necessary to break the mistletoe, and probably, as in the case of
        Balder, to throw it at him. And to complete the parallel, it is only
        necessary to suppose that the King of the Wood was formerly burned,
        dead or alive, at the midsummer fire festival which, as we have seen,
        was annually celebrated in the Arician grove.<a id="noteref_694"

        probably fed with the sacred oak-wood; and thus it would be in a
        great fire of oak that the King of the Wood formerly met his end. At
        a later time, as I have suggested, his annual tenure of office was
        lengthened or shortened, as the case might be, by the rule which
        allowed him to live so long as he could prove his divine right by the
        strong hand. But he only escaped the fire to fall by the sword.</p>

        But for four weeks previously, and during the whole of the Advent

        church, and never to use holy water; you must busy yourself all day
        long with devilish thoughts, and cherish an ardent wish that the
        devil would help you to get money. Thus prepared you take your stand,
        between eleven and twelve on Christmas night, at the meeting of two
        roads, over both of which corpses have been carried to the
        churchyard. Here many people meet you, some of them dead and buried
        long ago, it may be your parents or grandparents, or old friends and
        acquaintances, and they stop and greet you, and ask, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What are you doing here?”</span> And tiny little goblins
        hop and dance about and try to make you laugh. But if you smile or
        utter a single word, the devil will tear you to shreds and tatters on
        the spot. If, however, you stand glum and silent and solemn, there
        will come, after all the ghostly train has passed by, a man dressed
        as a hunter, and that is the devil. He will hand you a paper cornet
        full of fern-seed, which you must keep and carry about with you as
        long as you live. It will give you the power of doing as much work at
        your trade in a day as twenty or thirty ordinary men could do in the
        same time. So you will grow very rich. But few people have the
        courage to go through with the ordeal. The people of Rotenburg tell
        of a weaver of their town, who lived some two hundred and fifty years
        ago and performed prodigies of weaving by a simple application of
        fern-seed which he had been so fortunate as to obtain, no doubt from
        the devil, though that is not expressly alleged <span class=

        this treasure, the lazy rascal worked only on Saturdays and spent all
        the rest of the week playing and drinking; yet in one day he wove far
        more cloth than any other skilled weaver who sat at his loom from
        morning to night every day of the week. Naturally he kept his own
        counsel, and nobody might ever have known how he did it, if it had
        not been for what, humanly speaking, you might call an accident,
        though for my part I cannot but regard it as the manifest finger of
        Providence. One day—it was the octave of a festival—the fellow had
        woven a web no less than a hundred ells long, and his mistress
        resolved to deliver it to her customer the same evening. So she put
        the cloth in a basket and away she trudged with it. Her way led her
        past a church, and as she passed the sacred edifice, she heard the
        tinkle of the holy bell which announced the elevation of the Host.
        Being a good woman she put her basket down, knelt beside it, and
        there, with the shadows gathering round her, committed herself to the
        care of God and his good angels and received, along with the kneeling
        congregation in the lighted church, the evening benediction, which
        kept her and them from all the perils and dangers of the night. Then
        rising refreshed she took up her basket. But what was her
        astonishment on looking into it to find the whole web reduced to a
        heap of yarn! The blessed words of the priest at the altar had undone
        the cursed spell of the Enemy of Mankind.<a id="noteref_713" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, on the
        principle of like by like, fern-seed is supposed to discover gold
        because it is itself golden; and for a similar reason it enriches its
        possessor with an unfailing supply of gold. But while the fern-seed
        is described as golden, it is equally described as glowing and
        fiery.<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href=
        "#note_714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a> Hence,
        when we consider that two great days for gathering the fabulous seed
        are Midsummer Eve and Christmas—that is, the two solstices (for
        Christmas is nothing but an old heathen celebration of the winter
        solstice)—we are led to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg
        291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        regard the fiery aspect of the fern-seed as primary, and its golden
        aspect as secondary and derivative. Fern-seed, in fact, would seem to
        be an emanation of the sun's fire at the two turning-points of its
        course, the summer and winter solstices. This view is confirmed by a
        German story in which a hunter is said to have procured fern-seed by
        shooting at the sun on Midsummer Day at noon; three drops of blood
        fell down, which he caught in a white cloth, and these blood-drops
        were the fern-seed.<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a> Here
        the blood is clearly the blood of the sun, from which the fern-seed
        is thus directly derived. Thus it may be taken as probable that
        fern-seed is golden, because it is believed to be an emanation of the
        sun's golden fire.</p>

        gold, it must be in its character of the Golden Bough; and if it is
        gathered at the solstices, must not the Golden Bough, like the golden
        fern-seed, be an emanation of the sun's fire? The question cannot be
        answered with a simple affirmative. We have seen that the old Aryans
        perhaps kindled the solstitial and other ceremonial fires in part as
        sun-charms, that is, with the intention of supplying the sun with
        fresh fire; and as these fires were usually made by the friction or
        combustion of oak-wood,<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href=
        "#note_718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a> it may
        have appeared to the ancient Aryan that the sun was periodically
        recruited from the fire which resided in the sacred oak. In other
        words, the oak may have seemed to him the original storehouse or
        reservoir of the fire which was from time to time drawn out to feed
        the sun. But if the life of the oak was conceived to be in the
        mistletoe, the mistletoe must on that view have contained the seed or
        germ of the fire which was elicited by friction from the wood of the
        oak. Thus, instead of saying that the mistletoe was an emanation of
        the sun's fire, it might be more correct to say that the sun's fire
        was regarded as an emanation of the mistletoe. No wonder, then, that
        the mistletoe shone with a golden splendour, and was called the
        Golden Bough. Probably, however, like fern-seed, it was thought to
        assume its golden aspect only at those stated times, especially
        midsummer, when fire was drawn from the oak to light up the
        sun.<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href=
        "#note_719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a> At
        Pulverbatch, in Shropshire, it was believed within living memory that
        the oak-tree blooms on Midsummer Eve and the blossom withers before
        daylight. A maiden who wishes to know her lot in marriage should
        spread a white cloth under the tree at night, and in the morning she
        will find a little dust, which is all that remains of the flower. She
        should place the pinch of dust under her pillow, and then her future
        husband will appear to her in her dreams.<a id="noteref_720" name=

        fleeting bloom of the oak, if I am right, was probably the mistletoe
        in its character of the Golden Bough. The conjecture is confirmed by
        the observation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg
        293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        that in Wales a real sprig of mistletoe gathered on Midsummer Eve is
        similarly placed under the pillow to induce prophetic dreams;<a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">721</span></span></a> and
        further the mode of catching the imaginary bloom of the oak in a
        white cloth is exactly that which was employed by the Druids to catch
        the real mistletoe when it dropped from the bough of the oak, severed
        by the golden sickle.<a id="noteref_722" name="noteref_722" href=
        "#note_722"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">722</span></span></a> As
        Shropshire borders on Wales, the belief that the oak blooms on
        Midsummer Eve may be Welsh in its immediate origin, though probably
        the belief is a fragment of the primitive Aryan creed. In some parts
        of Italy, as we saw,<a id="noteref_723" name="noteref_723" href=
        "#note_723"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">723</span></span></a>
        peasants still go out on Midsummer morning to search the oak-trees
        for the <span class="tei tei-q">“oil of St. John,”</span> which, like
        the mistletoe, heals all wounds, and is, perhaps, the mistletoe
        itself in its glorified aspect. Thus it is easy to understand how a
        title like the Golden Bough, so little descriptive of its usual
        appearance on the tree, should have been applied to the seemingly
        insignificant parasite. Further, we can perhaps see why in antiquity
        mistletoe was believed to possess the remarkable property of
        extinguishing fire,<a id="noteref_724" name="noteref_724" href=
        "#note_724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
        considerations may partially explain why Virgil makes Aeneas carry a
        glorified bough of mistletoe with him on his descent into the gloomy
        subterranean world. The poet describes how at the very gates of hell
        there stretched a vast and gloomy wood, and how the hero, following
        the flight of two doves that lured him on, wandered into the depths
        of the immemorial forest till he saw afar off through the shadows of
        the trees the flickering light of the Golden Bough illuminating the
        matted boughs overhead.<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href=

        to his feet as well as a rod and staff to his hands? Armed with it he
        might boldly confront the dreadful spectres that would cross his path
        on his adventurous journey. Hence when Aeneas, emerging from the

        through the infernal marsh, and the surly ferryman refuses him
        passage in his boat, he has but to draw the Golden Bough from his
        bosom and hold it up, and straightway the blusterer quails at the

        deep in the water under the unusual weight of the living man.<a id=

        There is some reason to suppose that when Orpheus in like manner
        descended alive to hell to rescue the soul of his dead wife Eurydice
        from the shades, he carried with him a willow bough to serve as a
        passport on his journey to and from the land of the dead; for in the
        great frescoes representing the nether world, with which the master
        hand of Polygnotus adorned the walls of a loggia at Delphi, Orpheus
        was depicted sitting pensively under a willow, holding his lyre, now
        silent and useless, in his left hand, while with his right he grasped
        the drooping boughs of the tree.<a id="noteref_730" name=

        Virbius was, as I have tried to shew, a tree-spirit, he must have
        been the spirit of the oak on which grew the Golden Bough; for
        tradition represented him as the first of the Kings of the Wood. As
        an oak-spirit he must have been supposed periodically to rekindle the
        sun's fire, and might therefore easily be confounded with the sun
        itself. Similarly we can explain why Balder, an oak-spirit, was
        described as <span class="tei tei-q">“so fair of face and so shining

        he should have been so often taken to be the sun. And in general we
        may say that in primitive society, when the only known way of making
        fire is by the friction of wood, the savage must necessarily conceive
        of fire as a property stored away, like sap or juice, in trees, from
        which he has laboriously to extract it. The Senal Indians of
        California <span class="tei tei-q">“profess to believe that the whole

        Similarly the Maidu Indians of California hold that <span class=

        been struck by lightning is naturally regarded by the savage as
        charged with a double or triple portion of fire; for has he not seen
        the mighty flash enter into the trunk with his own eyes? Hence
        perhaps we may explain some of the many superstitious beliefs
        concerning trees that have been struck by lightning. Thus in the
        opinion of the Cherokee Indians <span class="tei tei-q">“mysterious
        properties attach to the wood of a tree which has been struck by
        lightning, especially when the tree itself still lives, and such wood
        enters largely into the secret compounds of the conjurers. An
        ordinary person of the laity will not touch it, for fear of having
        cracks come upon his hands and feet, nor is it burned for fuel, for
        fear that lye made from the ashes will cause consumption. In
        preparing ballplayers for the contest, the medicine-man sometimes
        burns splinters of it to coal, which he gives to the players to paint
        themselves with, in order that they may be able to strike their
        opponents with all the force of a thunderbolt. Bark or wood from a
        tree struck by lightning, but still green, is beaten up and put into
        the water in which seeds are soaked before planting, to insure a good
        crop, but, on the other hand, any lightning-struck wood thrown into
        the field will cause the crop to wither, and it is believed to have a
        bad effect even to go into the field immediately after having been
        near such a tree.”</span><a id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740" href=

        Apparently the Cherokees imagine that when wood struck by lightning
        is soaked in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg
        297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        water the fierce heat of the slumbering fire in its veins is tempered
        to a genial warmth, which promotes the growth of the crops; but that
        when the force of the fire has not been thus diluted it blasts the
        growing corn. When the Thompson Indians of British Columbia wished to
        set fire to the houses of their enemies, they shot at them arrows
        which were either made from a tree that had been struck by lightning
        or had splinters of such wood attached to them.<a id="noteref_741"
        name="noteref_741" href="#note_741"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a> They
        seem to have thought that wood struck by lightning was so charged
        with fire that it would ignite whatever it struck, the mere
        concussion sufficing to explode it like gunpowder. Yet curiously
        enough these Indians supposed that if they burned the wood of trees
        that had been struck by lightning, the weather would immediately turn
        cold.<a id="noteref_742" name="noteref_742" href=
        "#note_742"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">742</span></span></a> Perhaps
        they conceived such trees as reservoirs of heat, and imagined that by
        using them up they would exhaust the supply and thus lower the
        temperature of the atmosphere.<a id="noteref_743" name="noteref_743"
        href="#note_743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a> Wendish
        peasants of Saxony similarly refuse to burn in their stoves the wood
        of trees that have been struck by lightning; but the reason they give
        for their refusal is different. They say that with such fuel the
        house would be burnt down.<a id="noteref_744" name="noteref_744"
        href="#note_744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">744</span></span></a> No
        doubt they think that the electric flash, inherent in the wood, would
        send such a roaring flame up the chimney that nothing could stand
        before it. In like manner the Thonga of South Africa will not use
        such wood as fuel nor warm themselves at a fire which has been
        kindled with it; but what danger they apprehend from the wood we are
        not told.<a id="noteref_745" name="noteref_745" href=
        "#note_745"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">745</span></span></a> On the
        contrary, when lightning sets fire to a tree, the Winamwanga of
        Northern Rhodesia put out all the fires in the village and plaster
        the fireplaces afresh, while the head men convey the
        lightning-kindled fire to the chief, who prays over it. The chief
        then sends out <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg
        298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        new fire to all his villages, and the villagers reward his messengers
        for the boon. This shews that they look upon fire kindled by
        lightning with reverence, and the reverence is intelligible, for they
        speak of thunder and lightning as God himself coming down to
        earth.<a id="noteref_746" name="noteref_746" href=
        "#note_746"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Similarly the Maidu Indians of California believe that a Great Man
        created the world and all its inhabitants, and that lightning is
        nothing but the Great Man himself descending swiftly out of heaven
        and rending the trees with his flaming arm.<a id="noteref_747" name=

        derived from the much greater frequency with which the oak appears to
        be struck by lightning than any other tree of our European forests.
        Some remarkable statistics have been adduced in support of this view
        by Mr. W. Warde Fowler.<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href=

        Observations, annually made in the forests of Lippe-Detmold for
        seventeen years, yielded the result that while the woods were mainly
        stocked with beech and only to a small extent with oak and Scotch
        pine, yet far more oaks and Scotch pines were struck by lightning
        than beeches, the number of stricken Scotch pines exceeding the
        number of stricken beeches in the proportion of thirty-seven to one,
        and the number of stricken oaks exceeding the number of stricken
        beeches in the proportion <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg
        299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        no less than sixty to one. Similar results have been obtained from
        observations made in French and Bavarian forests.<a id="noteref_750"

        short, it would seem from statistics compiled by scientific
        observers, who have no mythological theories to maintain, that the
        oak suffers from the stroke of lightning far oftener than any other
        forest tree in Europe. However we may explain it, whether by the
        easier passage of electricity through oakwood than through any other
        timber,<a id="noteref_751" name="noteref_751" href=
        "#note_751"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">751</span></span></a> or in
        some other way, the fact itself may well have attracted the notice of
        our rude forefathers, who dwelt in the vast forests which then
        covered a large part of Europe; and they might naturally account for
        it in their simple religious way by supposing that the great sky-god,
        whom they worshipped and whose awful voice they heard in the roll of
        thunder, loved the oak above all the trees of the wood and often
        descended into it from the murky cloud in a flash of lightning,
        leaving a token of his presence or of his passage in the riven and
        blackened trunk and the blasted foliage. Such trees would thenceforth
        be encircled by a nimbus of glory as the visible seats of the
        thundering sky-god. Certain it is that, like some savages, both
        Greeks and Romans identified their great god of the sky and of the
        oak with the lightning flash which struck the ground; and they
        regularly enclosed such a stricken spot and treated it thereafter as
        sacred.<a id="noteref_752" name="noteref_752" href=

        the ancestors of the Celts and Germans in the forests of Central
        Europe paid a like respect for like reasons to a blasted oak.</p>

        appears to be simpler and more probable than the explanation which I
        formerly adopted, namely, that the oak was worshipped primarily for
        the many benefits which our rude forefathers derived from the tree,
        particularly for the fire which they drew by friction from its wood;
        and that the connexion of the oak with the sky was an after-thought
        based on the belief that the flash of lightning was nothing but the
        spark which the sky-god up aloft elicited by rubbing two pieces of
        oak wood against each other, just as his savage worshipper kindled
        fire in the forest on earth.<a id="noteref_755" name="noteref_755"

        theory the god of the thunder and the sky was derived from the
        original god of the oak; on the present theory, which I now prefer,
        the god of the sky and the thunder was the great original deity of
        our Aryan ancestors, and his association with the oak was merely an
        inference based on the frequency with which the oak was seen to be
        struck by lightning. If the Aryans, as some think, roamed the wide
        steppes of Russia or Central Asia with their flocks and herds before
        they plunged into the gloom of the European forests, they may have
        worshipped the god of the blue or cloudy firmament and the flashing
        thunderbolt long before they thought of associating him with the
        blasted oaks in their new home.<a id="noteref_756" name="noteref_756"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps the new
        theory has the further advantage of throwing light on the special
        sanctity ascribed to mistletoe which grows on an oak. The mere rarity
        of such a growth on an oak hardly suffices to explain the extent and
        the persistence of the superstition. A hint of its real origin is
        possibly furnished by the statement of Pliny that the Druids
        worshipped the plant because they believed it to have fallen from
        heaven and to be a token that the tree on which it grew was chosen by
        the god himself.<a id="noteref_757" name="noteref_757" href=

        they have thought that the mistletoe dropped on the oak in a flash of
        lightning? The conjecture is confirmed by the name thunder-besom
        which is applied to mistletoe in the Swiss canton of Aargau,<a id=
        "noteref_758" name="noteref_758" href="#note_758"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">758</span></span></a> for the
        epithet clearly implies a close connexion between the parasite and
        the thunder; indeed <span class="tei tei-q">“thunder-besom”</span> is
        a popular name in Germany for any bushy nest-like excrescence growing
        on a branch, because such a parasitic growth is actually believed by
        the ignorant to be a product of lightning.<a id="noteref_759" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">759</span></span></a> If
        there is any truth in this conjecture, the real reason why the Druids
        worshipped a mistletoe-bearing oak above all other trees of the
        forest was a belief that every such oak had not only been struck by
        lightning but bore among its branches a visible emanation of the
        celestial fire; so that in cutting the mistletoe with mystic rites
        they were securing for themselves all the magical properties of a
        thunderbolt. If that was so, we must apparently conclude that the
        mistletoe was deemed an emanation of the lightning rather than, as I
        have thus far argued, of the midsummer sun. Perhaps, indeed, we might
        combine the two seemingly divergent views by supposing that in the
        old Aryan creed the mistletoe descended from the sun on Midsummer Day
        in a flash of lightning. But such a combination is artificial and
        unsupported, so far as I know, by any positive evidence. Whether on
        mythical principles the two interpretations can really be reconciled
        with each other or not, I will not presume to say; but even should
        they prove to be discrepant, the inconsistency need not have
        prevented our rude forefathers from embracing both of them at the
        same time with an equal fervour of conviction; for like the great
        majority of mankind the savage is above being <span class=

        logic. In attempting to track his devious thought through the jungle
        of crass ignorance and blind fear, we must always remember that we
        are treading enchanted ground, and must beware of taking for solid
        realities the cloudy shapes that cross our path or hover and gibber
        at us through the gloom. We can never completely replace ourselves at
        the standpoint of primitive man, see things with his eyes, and feel
        our hearts beat with the emotions that stirred his. All our theories
        concerning him and his ways must therefore fall far short of
        certainty; the utmost we can aspire to in such matters is a
        reasonable degree of probability.</p>

        the boughs, so long no harm could befall the good and kindly god of

        of our enquiry, but as often happens in the search after truth, if we
        have answered one question, we have raised many more; if we have
        followed one track home, we have had to pass by others that opened
        off it and led, or seemed to lead, to far other goals than the sacred
        grove at Nemi. Some of these paths we have followed a little way;
        others, if fortune should be kind, the writer and the reader may one
        day pursue together. For the present we have journeyed far enough
        together, and it is time to part. Yet before we do so, we may well
        ask ourselves whether there is not some more general conclusion, some
        lesson, if possible, of hope and encouragement, to be drawn from the
        melancholy record of human error and folly which has engaged our
        attention in these volumes.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If then we
        consider, on the one hand, the essential similarity of man's chief
        wants everywhere and at all times, and on the other hand, the wide
        difference between the means he has adopted to satisfy them in
        different ages, we shall perhaps be disposed to conclude that the
        movement of the higher thought, so far as we can trace it, has on the
        whole been from magic through religion to science. In magic man
        depends on his own strength to meet the difficulties and dangers that
        beset him on every side. He believes in a certain established order
        of nature on which he can surely count, and which he can manipulate
        for his own ends. When he discovers his mistake, when he recognizes
        sadly that both the order of nature which he had assumed and the
        control which he had believed himself to exercise <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> over it were purely imaginary, he ceases
        to rely on his own intelligence and his own unaided efforts, and
        throws himself humbly on the mercy of certain great invisible beings
        behind the veil of nature, to whom he now ascribes all those
        far-reaching powers which he once arrogated to himself. Thus in the
        acuter minds magic is gradually superseded by religion, which
        explains the succession of natural phenomena as regulated by the
        will, the passion, or the caprice of spiritual beings like man in
        kind, though vastly superior to him in power.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as time goes
        on this explanation in its turn proves to be unsatisfactory. For it
        assumes that the succession of natural events is not determined by
        immutable laws, but is to some extent variable and irregular, and
        this assumption is not borne out by closer observation. On the
        contrary, the more we scrutinize that succession the more we are
        struck by the rigid uniformity, the punctual precision with which,
        wherever we can follow them, the operations of nature are carried on.
        Every great advance in knowledge has extended the sphere of order and
        correspondingly restricted the sphere of apparent disorder in the
        world, till now we are ready to anticipate that even in regions where
        chance and confusion appear still to reign, a fuller knowledge would
        everywhere reduce the seeming chaos to cosmos. Thus the keener minds,
        still pressing forward to a deeper solution of the mysteries of the
        universe, come to reject the religious theory of nature as
        inadequate, and to revert in a measure to the older standpoint of
        magic by postulating explicitly, what in magic had only been
        implicitly assumed, to wit, an inflexible regularity in the order of
        natural events, which, if carefully observed, enables us to foresee
        their course with certainty and to act accordingly. In short,
        religion, regarded as an explanation of nature, is displaced by
        science.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while science
        has this much in common with magic that both rest on a faith in order
        as the underlying principle of all things, readers of this work will
        hardly need to be reminded that the order presupposed by magic
        differs widely from that which forms the basis of science. The
        difference flows naturally from the different modes in which the two
        orders have been reached. For <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> whereas the order on which magic reckons is
        merely an extension, by false analogy, of the order in which ideas
        present themselves to our minds, the order laid down by science is
        derived from patient and exact observation of the phenomena
        themselves. The abundance, the solidity, and the splendour of the
        results already achieved by science are well fitted to inspire us
        with a cheerful confidence in the soundness of its method. Here at
        last, after groping about in the dark for countless ages, man has hit
        upon a clue to the labyrinth, a golden key that opens many locks in
        the treasury of nature. It is probably not too much to say that the
        hope of progress—moral and intellectual as well as material—in the
        future is bound up with the fortunes of science, and that every
        obstacle placed in the way of scientific discovery is a wrong to
        humanity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the history of
        thought should warn us against concluding that because the scientific
        theory of the world is the best that has yet been formulated, it is
        necessarily complete and final. We must remember that at bottom the
        generalizations of science or, in common parlance, the laws of nature
        are merely hypotheses devised to explain that ever-shifting
        phantasmagoria of thought which we dignify with the high-sounding
        names of the world and the universe. In the last analysis magic,
        religion, and science are nothing but theories of thought; and as
        science has supplanted its predecessors, so it may hereafter be
        itself superseded by some more perfect hypothesis, perhaps by some
        totally different way of looking at the phenomena—of registering the
        shadows on the screen—of which we in this generation can form no
        idea. The advance of knowledge is an infinite progression towards a
        goal that for ever recedes. We need not murmur at the endless

        black thread of magic, the red thread of religion, and the white
        thread of science, if under science we may include those simple
        truths, drawn from observation of nature, of which men in all ages
        have possessed a store. Could we then survey the web of thought from
        the beginning, we should probably perceive it to be at first a
        chequer of black and white, a patchwork of true and false notions,
        hardly tinged as yet by the red thread of religion. But carry your
        eye further along the fabric and you will remark that, while the
        black and white chequer still runs through it, there rests on the
        middle portion of the web, where religion has entered most deeply
        into its texture, a dark crimson stain, which shades off insensibly
        into a lighter tint as the white thread of science is woven more and
        more into the tissue. To a web thus chequered and stained, thus shot
        with threads of diverse hues, but gradually changing colour the
        farther it is unrolled, the state of modern thought, with all its
        divergent aims and conflicting tendencies, may be compared. Will the
        great movement which for centuries has been slowly altering the
        complexion of thought be continued in the near future? or will a
        reaction set in which may arrest progress and even undo much that has
        been done? To keep up our parable, what will be the colour of the web
        which the Fates are now weaving on the humming loom of time? will it
        be white or red? We cannot tell. A faint glimmering light illumines
        the backward portion of the web. Clouds and thick darkness hide the
        other end.</p>

          that some women have the power to change their soul into a black
          cat, who then goes about in the houses where there are sick people.
          Such a cat has a peculiar way of mewing quite different from its
          brethren, and is easily recognised. It steals quietly into the
          house, licks the lips of the sick man and eats of the food that has
          been prepared for him. The sick man soon gets worse and dies. They
          say it is very difficult to catch the cat, as it has all the
          nimbleness of its nature and the cleverness of a <span class=

          "font-style: italic">bhut</span></span>. However, they sometimes
          succeed, and then something wonderful happens. The woman out of
          whom the cat has come remains insensible, as it were in a state of
          temporary death, until the cat re-enters her body. Any wound
          inflicted on the cat will be inflicted on her; if they cut its ears
          or break its legs or put out its eyes the woman will suffer the
          same mutilation. The Uraons say that formerly they used to burn any
          woman that was suspected to be a <span class=

          Africa tell such a story of a great sorcerer, whom they now worship
          as a dispenser of sunshine and rain. The legend and the worship are
          reported as follows by a native African traveller:—</p>

          their coming the chiefs greet him. His answer consists in a humming
          noise, which sounds like the patter of rain. If one among them is a
          bad man, the ghost says to them, <span class="tei tei-q">‘There is

          grow tall, everywhere there is sickness, therefore we beg thee,
          give us rain.’</span> Thereupon the ghost hums a second time, and
          all are glad, because he has answered them. But if the ghost is
          angry, he does not answer but holds his peace. If he has made them
          glad and given an answer, much rain will fall; otherwise they
          return as they went in sunshine.</span></p>

          body. But he lived at strife with his wife. She said to his

          sought the stalk of a gourd, and when they smote him with it, he
          died at once without so much as setting one foot from the spot. But
          of him and his departure there was nothing more to be seen, for
          suddenly a great storm blew, and no man knew whither he had gone.
          The storm is said to have carried him to that cave which is still
          there to this day. After some days people saw in the cave his
          weapons, clothes, and turban lying, and they brought word to the
          folk in the town, <span class="tei tei-q">‘We have seen the clothes
          of the elder in the cave, but of himself we have perceived
          nothing.’</span> The folk went thither to look about, and they
          found that it was so. So the news of this ghost spread, all the
          more because people had seen the marvel that a man died and nobody
          knew where he had gone. The wonderful thing in this wood is that
          the spirits dwell in the midst of the wood and that everywhere a
          bright white sand lies on the ground, as if people had gone thither
          for the purpose of keeping everything clean. On many days they hear
          a drumming and shouts of joy in this wood, as if a marriage feast

          like the African sorcerer, who is now worshipped in a cave and
          bestows rain or sunshine on his votaries. On the whole I incline to
          regard this solution of the Balder problem as more probable than
          the one I have advocated in the text, namely that Balder was a
          mythical personification of a mistletoe-bearing oak. The facts
          which seem to incline the balance to the side of Euhemerism reached
          me as my book was going to press and too late to be embodied in
          their proper place in the volumes. The acceptance of this
          hypothesis would not necessarily break the analogy which I have
          traced between Balder in his sacred grove on the Sogne fiord of
          Norway and the priest of Diana in the sacred grove of Nemi; indeed,
          it might even be thought rather to strengthen the resemblance
          between the two, since there is no doubt at all that the priests of
          Diana at Nemi were men who lived real lives and died real
          deaths.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now to
          ask, Did Virgil compare the Golden Bough to the common mistletoe
          (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Viscum album</span></span>) or to the
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Loranthus europaeus</span></span>? Some modern
          enquirers decide in favour of the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Loranthus</span></span>. Many years ago Sir
          Francis Darwin wrote to me:<a id="noteref_796" name="noteref_796"
          href="#note_796"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">796</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder whether <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Loranthus europaeus</span></span> would do for
          your Golden Bough. It is a sort of mistletoe growing on oaks and
          chestnuts in S. Europe. In the autumn it produces what are
          described as bunches of pretty yellow berries. It is not evergreen
          like the mistletoe, but deciduous, and as its leaves appear at the
          same time as the oak <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg
          319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          leaves and drop at the same time in autumn, it must look like a
          branch of the oak, more especially as it has rough bark with
          lichens often growing on it. <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Loranthus</span></span> is said to be a
          hundred years old sometimes.”</span> Professor P. J. Veth, after
          quoting the passage from Virgil, writes that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“almost all translators (including Vondel) and
          commentators of the Mantuan bard think that the mistletoe is here
          meant, probably for the simple reason that it was better known to
          them than <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Loranthus
          europaeus</span></span>. I am convinced that Virgil can only have
          thought of the latter. On the other side of the Alps the
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Loranthus</span></span> is much commoner than
          the mistletoe; on account of its splendid red blossoms, sometimes
          twenty centimetres long, it is a far larger and more conspicuous
          ornament of the trees; it bears really golden yellow fruit
          (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Croceus fetus</span></span>), whereas the
          berries of the mistletoe are almost white; and it attaches itself
          by preference to the oak, whereas the mistletoe is very seldom
          found on the oak.”</span><a id="noteref_797" name="noteref_797"

          Again, Mr. W. R. Paton writes to me from Mount Athos:<a id=
          "noteref_798" name="noteref_798" href="#note_798"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“The oak is here called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">dendron</span></span>, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em>
          tree. As for the mistletoe there are two varieties, both called
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">axo</span></span> (ancient ἰξός). Both are
          used to make bird-lime. The real <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Golden
          Bough</span></span> is the variety with yellow berries and no
          leaves. It is the parasite of the oak and rarely grows on other
          trees. It is very abundant, and now in winter the oak-trees which
          have adopted it seem from a distance to be draped in a golden
          tissue. The other variety is our own mistletoe and is strictly a
          parasite of the fir (a spruce fir, I don't know its scientific
          name). It is also very abundant.”</span></p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in favour
          of identifying Virgil's mistletoe (<span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">viscum</span></span>) with <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Loranthus</span></span> rather than with
          common mistletoe it has been urged, first, that the berries of
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Loranthus</span></span> are bright yellow,
          whereas those of the mistletoe are of a greenish white; and,
          second, that the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Loranthus</span></span>
          commonly grows on oaks, whereas mistletoe seldom does so, indeed in
          Italy mistletoe is said never to be found on an oak. Both these
          circumstances certainly speak strongly in favour of <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Loranthus</span></span>; since Virgil
          definitely describes the berries as of a saffron-yellow
          (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">croceus</span></span>) and says that the plant
          grew on a holm-oak. Yet on the other hand Virgil tells us that the
          plant put forth fresh leaves in the depths of winter (<span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">brumali frigore</span></span>, strictly
          speaking, <span class="tei tei-q">“the cold of the winter
          solstice”</span>); and this would best apply to the common
          mistletoe, which is evergreen, whereas <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Loranthus</span></span> is deciduous.<a id=
          "noteref_799" name="noteref_799" href="#note_799"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">799</span></span></a>
          Accordingly, if we must decide between the two species, this single
          circumstance appears to incline the balance in favour of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name=
          "Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> common mistletoe.
          But is it not possible that Virgil, whether consciously or
          unconsciously, confused the two plants and combined traits from
          both in his description? Both parasites are common in Italy and in
          appearance they are much alike except for the colour of the
          berries. As a loving observer of nature, Virgil was probably
          familiar by sight with both, but he may not have examined them
          closely; and he might be excused if he thought that the parasite
          which he saw growing, with its clusters of bright yellow berries,
          on oaks in winter, was identical with the similar parasite which he
          saw growing, with its bunches of greenish white berries and its
          pale green leaves, on many other trees of the forest. The confusion
          would be all the more natural if the Celts of northern Italy, in
          whose country the poet was born, resembled the modern Celts of
          Brittany in attaching bunches of the common mistletoe to their
          cottages and leaving them there till the revolving months had
          tinged the pale berries, leaves, and twigs with a golden yellow,
          thereby converting the branch of mistletoe into a true Golden
          Bough.</p>

          make up the town of Bangalore in Southern India, one woman at least
          from every house is expected to walk through the fire at the
          village festival. Captain J. S. F. Mackenzie witnessed the ceremony
          in 1873. A trench, four feet long by two feet wide, was filled with
          live embers. The priest walked through it thrice, and the women
          afterwards passed through it in batches. Capt. Mackenzie remarks:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“From the description one reads of walking
          through fire, I expected something sensational. Nothing could be
          more tame than the ceremony we saw performed; in which there never
          was nor ever could be the slightest danger to life. Some young
          girl, whose soles were tender, might next morning find that she had
          a blister, but this would be the extent of harm she could
          receive.”</span> See Captain J. S. F. Mackenzie, <span class=

          such an accident is known to have occurred at a village in Bengal.

          me by two eye-witnesses, Mr. Ernest Foxwell of St. John's College,
          Cambridge, and Miss E. P. Hughes, formerly Principal of the
          Teachers' Training College, Cambridge. Mr. Foxwell examined the
          feet of the performers both before and after their passage through
          the fire and found no hurt. The heat was so great that the sweat
          ran down him as he stood near the bed of glowing charcoal. He
          cannot explain the immunity of the performers. He informs me that
          the American writer Percival Lowell walked in the fire and was
          burned so severely that he was laid up in bed for three weeks;
          while on the other hand a Scotch engineer named Hillhouse passed
          over the hot charcoal unscathed. Several of Miss Hughes's Japanese
          pupils also went through the ordeal with impunity, but one of them
          burned a toe. Both before and after walking through the fire the
          people dipped their feet in a white stuff which Miss Hughes was
          told was salt. Compare W. G. Aston, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shinto</span></span>
          (London, 1905), p. 348: <span class="tei tei-q">“At the present day
          plunging the hand into boiling water, walking barefoot over a bed
          of live coals, and climbing a ladder formed of sword-blades set

          From a later account we learn that about the year 1890 the custom
          of lighting a bonfire and dancing round it was still observed at
          Bagnères de Luchon on Midsummer Eve, but the practice of burning
          live serpents in it had been discontinued. The fire was kindled by
          a priest. See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          during my stay at Geneva. The people are so universally infatuated
          with the notion, that if a cow falls sick, it is ten to one but an
          old woman is clapt up in prison for it, and if the poor creature

          In England mugwort is very common in waste ground, hedges, and the
          borders of fields. It flowers throughout August and later. The root
          is woody and perennial. The smooth stems, three or four feet high,
          are erect, branched, and leafy, and marked by many longitudinal
          purplish ribs. The pinnatified leaves alternate on the stalk; they
          are smooth and dark green above, cottony and very white below. The
          flowers are in simple leafy spikes or clusters; the florets are
          purplish, furnished with five stamens and five awl-shaped female
          flowers, which constitute the radius. The whole plant has a weak
          aromatic scent and a slightly bitter flavour. Its medical virtues
          are of no importance. See James Sowerby, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English
          Botany</span></span>, xiv. (London, 1802) p. 978. Altogether it is
          not easy to see why such an inconspicuous and insignificant flower
          should play so large a part in popular superstition. Mugwort
          (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Artemisia vulgaris</span></span>) is not to be
          confounded with wormwood (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Artemisia
          absinthium</span></span>), which is quite a different flower in
          appearance, though it belongs to the same genus. Wormwood is common
          in England, flowering about August. The flowers are in clusters,
          each of them broad, hemispherical, and drooping, with a
          buff-coloured disc. The whole plant is of a pale whitish green and
          clothed with a short silky down. It is remarkable for its intense
          bitterness united to a peculiar strong aromatic odour. It is often
          used to keep insects from clothes and furniture, and as a medicine
          is one of the most active bitters. See James Sowerby, <span class=

          The custom is reported from the Emmenthal. In Germany a root of
          orpine, dug up on St. John's morning and hung between the

          say that the hazel branch which is to serve as a divining-rod
          should be cut at midnight on Good Friday, and that it should be
          laid on the altar and mass said over it. If that is done, we are

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Pliny, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nat.
          Hist.</span></span> xvi. 249-251. In the first edition of this book
          I understood Pliny to say that the Druidical ceremony of cutting
          the mistletoe fell in the sixth month, that is, in June; and hence
          I argued that it probably formed part of the midsummer festival.
          But in accordance with Latin usage the words of Pliny (<span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sexta luna</span></span>, literally
          <span class="tei tei-q">“sixth moon”</span>) can only mean
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the sixth day of the month.”</span> I have
          to thank my friend Mr. W. Warde Fowler for courteously pointing out
          my mistake to me. Compare my note in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Athenaeum</span></span>, November 21st, 1891,
          p. 687. I also misunderstood Pliny's words, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">et saeculi post tricesimum
          annum, quia jam virium abunde habeat nec sit sui
          dimidia</span></span>,”</span> applying them to the tree instead of
          to the moon, to which they really refer. After <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">saeculi</span></span> we must understand
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">principium</span></span> from the preceding
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">principia</span></span>. With the thirty
          years' cycle of the Druids we may compare the sixty years' cycle of
          the Boeotian festival of the Great Daedala (Pausanias, ix. 3. 5;
          see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
          Magic Art and the Evolution of Kings</span></span>, ii. 140
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>), which, like the Druidical
          rite in question, was essentially a worship, or perhaps rather a
          conjuration, of the sacred oak. Whether any deeper affinity, based
          on common Aryan descent, may be traced between the Boeotian and the
          Druidical ceremony, I do not pretend to determine. In India a cycle
          of sixty years, based on the sidereal revolution of Jupiter, has
          long been in use. The sidereal revolution of Jupiter is
          accomplished in approximately twelve solar years (more exactly 11
          years and 315 days), so that five of its revolutions make a period
          of approximately sixty years. It seems, further, that in India a
          much older cycle of sixty lunar years was recognized. See Christian

            Some of the ancients thought that the root of the marsh-mallow,
            which was used in medicine, should be dug up with gold and then
            preserved from contact with the ground (Pliny, <span class=

            ancient India it was prescribed by ritual that the horse should
            be slain by a golden knife, because <span class="tei tei-q">“gold
            is light”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“by means of the

            plants, to which medical or magical virtues were attributed,
            should not be cut with iron. See the fragment of Sophocles's

          murdered and his murderer is unknown, you are recommended to
          proceed as follows. You kindle a fire of dry oak-wood, you pour
          some of the blood from the wounds on the fire, and you change the
          poor man's shoes, putting the right shoe on the left foot, and

          note has now been happily fulfilled. Wilken's many scattered papers
          have been collected and published in a form which leaves nothing to
          be desired (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Wilken</span></span>, verzameld door Mr. F. D. E. van Ossenbruggen,

          ancient Egyptian tombs there are often found plaques or palettes of
          schist bearing traces of paint; some of them are decorated with
          engravings of animals or historical scenes, others are modelled in
          the shape of animals of various sorts, such as antelopes,
          hippopotamuses, birds, tortoises, and fish. As a rule only one such
          plaque is found in a tomb, and it lies near the hands of the mummy.
          It has been conjectured by M. Jean Capart that these plaques are
          amulets or soul-boxes, in which the external souls of the dead were
          supposed to be preserved. See Jean Capart, <span class=

          pp. 182 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          the west of Lake Victoria Nyanza, the afterbirth is similarly
          regarded as a sort of human being. Hence when twins are born the
          people speak of four children instead of two, reckoning the two
          afterbirths as two children. See H. Rehse, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kiziba, Land und
          Leute</span></span> (Stuttgart, 1910), p. 117. The conception of
          the afterbirth and navel-string as spiritual doubles of the child
          with whom they are born is held very firmly by the Kooboos, a
          primitive tribe of Sumatra. We are told that among these people
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a great vital power is ascribed to the
          navel-string and afterbirth; because they are looked upon as
          brother or sister of the infant, and though their bodies have not
          come to perfection, yet their soul and spirit are just as normal as
          those of the child and indeed have even reached a much higher stage
          of development. The navel-string (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">oeri</span></span>) and afterbirth
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tĕm-boeni</span></span>) visit the man who was
          born with them thrice a day and thrice by night till his death, or
          they hover near him (<span class="tei tei-q">‘<span lang="nl"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="nl"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">zweven voorbij hem
          heen</span></span>’</span>). They are the good spirits, a sort of
          guardian angels of the man who came into the world with them and
          who lives on earth; they are said to guard him from all evil. Hence
          it is that the Kooboo always thinks of his navel-string and
          afterbirth (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">oeri-tĕmboeni</span></span>) before he goes to
          sleep or to work, or undertakes a journey, and so on. Merely to
          think of them is enough; there is no need to invoke them, or to ask
          them anything, or to entreat them. By not thinking of them a man
          deprives himself of their good care.”</span> Immediately after the
          birth the navel-string and afterbirth are buried in the ground
          close by the spot where the birth took place; and a ceremony is
          performed over it, for were the ceremony omitted, the navel-string
          and afterbirth, <span class="tei tei-q">“instead of being a good
          spirit for the newly born child, might become an evil spirit for
          him and visit him with all sorts of calamities out of spite for
          this neglect.”</span> The nature of the ceremony performed over the
          spot is not described by our authority. The navel-string and
          afterbirth are often regarded by the Kooboos as one; their names
          are always mentioned together. See G. J. van Dongen, <span class=

          To ensure the success of the cure various additional precautions
          are sometimes recommended, as that the ash should be a maiden, that
          is a tree that has never been topped or cut; that the split should
          be made east and west; that the child should be passed into the
          tree by a maiden and taken out on the other side by a boy; that the
          child should always be passed through head foremost (but according
          to others feet foremost), and so forth. In Surrey we hear of a
          holly-tree being used instead of an ash (<span class=

          Mecklenburg it is sometimes required that the tree should have been
          split by lightning (K. Bartsch, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l.c.</span></span>).
          The whole subject of passing sick people through narrow apertures
          as a mode of cure has been well handled in an elegant little
          monograph (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Un Vieux Rite médical</span></span>, Paris,
          1892) by Monsieur H. Gaidoz, who rightly rejects the theory that
          all such passages are symbols of a new birth. But I cannot agree
          with him in thinking that the essence of the rite consists in the
          transference of the disease from the person to the tree; rather, it
          seems to me, the primary idea is that of interposing an impassable
          barrier between a fugitive and his pursuing foe, though no doubt
          the enemy thus left behind is apparently supposed to adhere to the
          further side of the obstacle (whether tree, stone, or what not)
          through which he cannot pass. However, the sympathetic relation
          supposed to exist between the sufferer and the tree through which
          he has been passed certainly favours the view that he has left some
          portion of himself attached to the tree. But in this as in many
          similar cases, the ideas in the minds of the persons who practise
          the custom are probably vague, confused, and inconsistent; and we
          need not attempt to define them precisely. Compare also R. Andree,

          the same people <span class="tei tei-q">“when a person is ill, they
          bring an ox to the place where he is laid. Two cuts are then made
          in one of its legs, extending down the whole length of it. The skin
          in the middle of the leg being raised up, the operator thrusts in
          his hand, to make way for that of the sick person, whose whole body
          is afterwards rubbed over with the blood of the animal. The ox
          after enduring this torment is killed, and those who are married
          and have children, as in the other case, are the only partakers of
          the feast.”</span> (J. Campbell, <span class=

          cit.</span></span> ii. 346 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>). Here the intention seems
          to be not so much to transfer the disease to the ox, as to
          transfuse the healthy life of the beast into the veins of the sick
          man. The same is perhaps true of the Welsh and French cure for
          whooping-cough, which consists in passing the little sufferer
          several times under an ass. See J. Brand, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Popular Antiquities

          whooping-cough <span class="tei tei-q">“is also practised in
          Ireland; only here the sufferer is passed round, that is, over and
          under, the body of an ass”</span> (letter of Miss A. H. Singleton
          to me, dated Rathmagle House, Abbey-Leix, Ireland, 24th February
          1904). But perhaps the intention rather is to give the
          whooping-cough to the animal; for it might reasonably be thought
          that the feeble whoop of the sick child would neither seriously
          impair the lungs, nor perceptibly augment the stentorian bray, of
          the donkey.</dd>

          According to Festus, the yoke under which Horatius passed was
          composed of three beams, two uprights, and a cross-piece. The
          similarity of the ceremony to that which was exacted from conquered

          practically the same explanation of both these Roman structures. I
          have left my exposition, except for one or two trivial verbal
          changes, exactly as it stood before I was aware that my friend had
          anticipated me in both conjectures. The closeness of the
          coincidence between our views is a welcome confirmation of their
          truth. As to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          Triumphalis</span></span>, the exact position of which is

          walls, but an archway standing by itself in the Campus Martius
          outside the city walls. He points out that in the oldest existing
          triumphal arch, that of Augustus at Ariminum, the most striking
          part of the structure consists of two upright Corinthian pillars
          with an architrave laid horizontally across them; and he
          ingeniously conjectures that we have here a reminiscence of the two
          uprights and the cross-piece, which, if our theory is correct, was
          the original form both of the triumphal arch and of the yoke.</dd>

            easily be distinguished from common snakes, for they frequent

            also have a scar; if he had only one eye, his serpent will have

            is how you can recognise So-and-So in his serpent form. Chiefs do
            not turn into the same kind of snakes as ordinary people. For
            common folk become harmless snakes with green and white bellies

          The same writer relates how a certain Indian named Gonzalez was
          reported to have the power of turning himself into a lion or rather
          a puma. Once when a Spaniard had shot a puma in the nose, Gonzalez
          was found with a bruised face and accused the Spaniard of having
          shot him. Another Indian chief named Gomez was said to have
          transformed himself into a puma, and in that shape to have fought a
          terrific battle with a rival chief named Lopez, who had changed
          himself into a jaguar. See Gage, <span class=

          had a special connexion with marriage. When young men were backward
          of taking wives, the women used to go out into the forest and kill
          an emu-wren, which was the men's <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“brother”</span>; then returning to the camp they
          shewed the dead bird to the men. The result was a fight between the
          young men and the young women, in which, however, lads who were not
          yet marriageable might not take part. Next day the marriageable
          young men went out and killed a superb warbler, which was the
          women's <span class="tei tei-q">“sister,”</span> and this led to a
          worse fight than before. Some days afterwards, when the wounds and
          bruises were healed, one of the marriageable young men met one of
          the marriageable young women, and said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Superb warbler!”</span> She answered, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Emu-wren! What does the emu-wren eat?”</span> To which

          so-and-so,”</span> naming kangaroo, opossum, emu, or some other
          game. Then they laughed, and she ran off with him without telling
          any one. See L. Fison and A. W. Howitt, <span class=

          that both the creatures thus assigned to the two sexes should be
          nocturnal in their habits. Perhaps the choice of such creatures is
          connected with the belief that the soul is absent from the body in
          slumber. On this hypothesis bats and owls would be regarded by
          these savages as the wandering souls of sleepers. Such a belief
          would fully account for the reluctance of the natives to kill them.
          The Kiowa Indians of North America think that owls and other night

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The following suggestion as to the
          origin of totemism was made in the first edition of this book
          (published in 1890) and is here reprinted without any substantial
          change. In the meantime much additional evidence as to the nature
          and prevalence of totemism has come to light, and with the new
          evidence my opinions, or rather conjectures, as to the origin of
          the institution have repeatedly changed. If I here reprint my
          earliest conjecture, it is partly because I still think it may
          contain an element of truth, and partly because it serves as a
          convenient peg on which to hang a collection of facts which are
          much more valuable than any theories of mine. The reader who
          desires to acquaint himself more fully with the facts of totemism
          and with the theories that have been broached on the subject, will
          find them stated at length in my <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Totemism and
          Exogamy</span></span> (London, 1910). Here I will only call
          attention to the Arunta legend that the ancestors of the tribe kept
          their spirits in certain sacred sticks and stones (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">churinga</span></span>), which bear a close
          resemblance to the well-known bull-roarers, and that when they went
          out hunting they hung these sticks or stones on certain sacred
          poles (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nurtunjas</span></span>) which represented
          their totems. See Baldwin Spencer and F. J. Gillen, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Native Tribes of
          Central Australia</span></span> (London, 1899), pp. 137
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>, 629. This tradition appears
          to point to a custom of transferring a man's soul or spirit
          temporarily to his totem. Conversely when an Arunta is sick he
          scrapes his <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">churinga</span></span> and swallows the
          scrapings, as if to restore to himself the spiritual substance
          deposited in the instrument. See Baldwin Spencer and F. J. Gillen,

          an intention seems to imply a belief in a sympathetic connexion
          between the man and the animal. Similarly the Siena of the Ivory
          Coast, in West Africa, who have totemism, believe that if a man
          kills one of his totemic animals, a member of his totemic clan dies
          instantaneously. See Maurice Delafosse, <span class="tei tei-q">“Le

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">In some tribes, chiefly of North
          American Indians, every man has an individual or personal totem in
          addition to the totem of his clan. This personal totem is usually
          the animal of which he dreamed during a long and solitary fast at
          puberty. See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Totemism and Exogamy</span></span>, i. 49-52,
          iii. 370-456, where the relation of the individual or personal
          totem (if we may call it so) to the clan totem is discussed. It is
          quite possible that, as some good authorities incline to believe,

          remaining five have no definite place of abode, but are so closely

          different account of Batta psychology is given by Mr. Westenberg.

          "font-style: italic">tendi</span></span> (not three or seven of
          them); and the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tendi</span></span> is something between a
          soul and a guardian spirit. It always resides outside of the body,
          and on its position near, before, behind, above, or below, the
          welfare of its owner is supposed in great measure to depend. But in
          addition each man has two invisible guardian spirits (his
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kaka</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          great danger; one is the seed by which he was begotten, the other
          is the afterbirth, and these he calls respectively his elder and
          his younger brother. Mr. Westenberg's account refers specially to
          the Karo-Battas. See C. J. Westenberg, <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          topics in regard to which the Ibans display any reluctance to speak
          freely. So great is their reserve in this connection that one of us
          lived for fourteen years on friendly terms with Ibans of various

          spirit of some ancestor or dead relative, but not always so, and it
          is not clear that it is always conceived as the spirit of a
          deceased human being. This spirit becomes the special protector of
          some individual Iban, to whom in a dream he manifests himself, in
          the first place in human form, and announces that he will be his
          secret helper.... When, as is most commonly the case, the secret
          helper takes on the form of some animal, all individuals of that
          species become objects of especial regard to the fortunate Iban; he
          will not kill or eat any such animal, and he will as far as
          possible restrain others from doing so.”</span> Thus the

          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          lover to induce the demons to carry off the soul of the jilt and so
          drive her mad. It is made of the frontal bone of a brave or skilful
          man, and some of the intended victim's hair is attached to it. See

          under the name of Ogboni. When the sound of the bull-roarer is

          bull-roarers are sounded by men to frighten novices at initiation.

          of South Africa and the Boloki of the Upper Congo the bull-roarer
          is a child's toy, but yet is thought to be endowed with magical
          virtue. See below, p. <a href="#Pg232" class="tei tei-ref">232</a>
          note 3. Among the Koskimo Indians of British Columbia the sound of
          the bull-roarers is supposed to be the voice of a spirit who comes
          to fetch away the novices. See Franz Boas, <span class=

          used as a sacred or magical instrument for the making of rain by
          the Zuñi and other Pueblo Indians of Arizona and New Mexico, also
          by the Navajos and Apaches of the same region, and by the Utes of

          bull-roarers at their festivals of the dead; the sound of them is
          the signal for the women to hide themselves; it is believed that

          be no inconsistency between the two statements. While custom
          required that every youth should be circumcised, the exact time for
          performing the ceremony need not have been rigidly prescribed; and
          if a saving or atoning virtue was attributed to the sacrifice of
          foreskins, it might be thought desirable in cases of emergency,

          "tei tei-q">“This period, however, is not necessarily restricted to
          two years. There are always a number of youths who are growing to
          the proper age, and the length of the interval depends upon the
          decision of the elders.”</span> Perhaps the seeming discrepancy
          between our authorities on this point may be explained by Mr.
          Joske's statement (p. 259) that the rites are held in alternate
          years by two different sets of men, the Kai Vesina and the Kai
          Rukuruku, both of whom claim to be descended from the original
          founders of the rites. The custom of dating the New Year by
          observation of the Pleiades was apparently universal among the
          Polynesians. See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          the fullest and I have followed it in the text. The custom was in
          vogue down to recent years, but seems to have been suppressed
          chiefly by the exertions of the missionaries. Besides the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          in these regions another secret society known as the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nkimba</span></span>, which some writers have
          confused with the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ndembo</span></span>. The <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nkimba</span></span> was of a more harmless
          character than the other; indeed it seems even to have served some
          useful purposes, partly as a kind of freemasonry which encouraged
          mutual help among its members, partly as a system of police for the
          repression of crime, its professed object being to put down
          witchcraft and punish witches. Only males were admitted to it.
          Candidates for initiation were stupefied by a drug, but there was
          apparently no pretence of killing them and bringing them to life
          again. Members of the society had a home in the jungle away from
          the town, where the novices lived together for a period varying
          from six months to two years. They learned a secret language, and
          received new names; it was afterwards an offence to call a man by
          the name of his childhood. Instead of the red dye affected by
          members of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          is remarkable, however, that in this tribe persons who are being
          initiated into the secret societies, of which there are six, are
          not always or even generally brought back by an artificial animal
          which represents their own totem. Thus while men of the eagle totem
          are brought back by an eagle which rises from underground, men of
          the bear clan return on the back of an artificial killer-whale
          which is towed across the river by ropes. Again, members of the
          wolf clan are brought back by an artificial bear, and members of
          the raven clan by a frog. In former times the appearance of the
          artificial totem animal, or of the guardian spirit, was considered
          a matter of great importance, and any failure which disclosed the
          deception to the uninitiated was deemed a grave misfortune which
          could only be atoned for by the death of the persons concerned in
          the disclosure.</dd>

          the same argument to the consideration of the growth of the secret

          "font-style: italic">Spirits of the Corn and of the
          Wild</span></span>, i. 277 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          combined with the blindness of Hother in the myth, suggest that the
          man who killed the human representative of the oak-spirit was
          blindfolded, and threw his weapon or the mistletoe from a little
          distance. After the Lapps had killed a bear—which was the occasion
          of many superstitious ceremonies—the bear's skin was hung on a
          post, and the women, blindfolded, shot arrows at it. See J.

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">This suggestion as to the origin of
          the name has been made to me by two correspondents independently.
          Miss Florence Grove, writing to me from 10 Milton Chambers, Cheyne
          Walk, London, on May 13th, 1901, tells me that she regularly hangs
          up a bough of mistletoe every year and allows it to remain till it
          is replaced by the new branch next year, and from her observation
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the mistletoe is actually a golden bough
          when kept a sufficiently long time.”</span> She was kind enough to
          send me some twigs of her old bough, which fully bore out her
          description. Again, Mrs. A. Stuart writes to me from Crear Cottage,
          Morningside Drive, Edinburgh, on June 26th, 1901: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As to why the mistletoe might be called the Golden
          Bough, my sister Miss Haig wishes me to tell you that last June,
          when she was in Brittany, she saw great bunches of mistletoe hung
          up in front of the houses in the villages. The leaves were
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bright
          golden</span></em>. You should hang up a branch next Christmas and
          keep it till June!”</span> The great hollow oak of
          Saint-Denis-des-Puits, in the French province of Perche, is called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the gilded or golden oak”</span>
          (<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=

          "tei tei-q">“in memory of the Druidical tradition of the mistletoe
          cut with a golden sickle.”</span> See Felix Chapiseau, <span class=

          Beauce et du Perche</span></span> (Paris, 1902), i. 97. Perhaps the
          name may be derived from bunches of withered mistletoe shining like
          gold in the sunshine among the branches.</dd>

          lightning is prominent in some of the customs observed in Patiko, a
          district of the Uganda Protectorate. If a village has suffered from
          lightning, ropes made of twisted grass are strung from peak to peak
          of the houses to ward off further strokes. And if a person has been
          struck or badly shaken, <span class="tei tei-q">“an elaborate cure
          is performed upon him. A red cock is taken, his tongue torn out,
          and his body dashed upon the house where the stroke fell. Then the
          scene changes to the bank of a small running stream, where the
          patient is made to kneel while the bird is sacrificed over the
          water. A raw egg is next given to the patient to swallow, and he is

              and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
              they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals
              and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
              Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
              secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
              Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help,

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
